//However, as an additional permission, the copyright holders of EncounterPRO Open Source

// 
//1) all access from the independent component to persisted data which resides inside any 
//   EncounterPRO Open Source data store (e.g. SQL Server database) be made through a 
//   publically available database driver (e.g. ODBC, SQL Native Client, etc) or through 
//   a service which itself is part of The Project.
//2) the independent component does not create or rely on any code or data structures 
//   within the EncounterPRO Open Source data store unless such code or data structures, 
//   and all code and data structures referred to by such code or data structures, are 
//   themselves part of The Project.
//3) the independent component either a) runs locally on the user's computer, or b) is 
//   linked to at runtime by The Project’s Component Manager object which in turn is 
//   called by code which itself is part of The Project.
//
//An independent component is a component which is not derived from or based on the
//Project. If you modify the Project, you may extend this additional permission to your
//version of the Project, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do
//so, delete this additional permission statement from your version.
