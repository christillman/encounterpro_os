Collect Procedures delivered in the database have the "specimen sent to:" and the "patient referred to" option at the top of the collect specimen procedure. <br /> 
 <br /> 
After you receive your database, if you create any new labs, test, x-ray, etc templates in your database, the following steps needs to be performed for each collect procedure that you create. <br /> 
 </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> </FONT>You can configure these options from the actual treatment observation screen using a test patient or go through the Configuration screens. It is often easier to modify observations in a patient context as you can immediately see the results of your changes. <br />
