Is there a way to make the change to the pdf file so that it only displays/prints at 75% instead of the 190% it currently does? </p>
 
 
 <p> 
As a test, printed rx from <STRONG>View</STRONG> screen of PDF file.&nbsp; From view, the default view is 190%.&nbsp; Changed that to 75% and selected printer from PDF file and printed.&nbsp; The rx printed as should.&nbsp;  <br />

They shouldn't print from "View."&nbsp; EncounterPRO can't keep a record of the printing if the print from "View".&nbsp; They are trained to print by clicking the "Print" button. </p>
 
 
<P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir=ltr>Even if they do print from "View", the default zoom is a function of the PDF viewer program and the printer driver.&nbsp; If they absolutely need to print from "View" then we say: </p>
 
 
<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir=ltr> 
<P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir=ltr>a) you shouldn't do that.&nbsp;  </p>
 
 
<P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir=ltr>b)&nbsp; you need to make whatever changes are needed on the print dialog box yourselves. </p>

Upon implementation of Document Manager, prescriptions now print full size on 8.5 x 11.&nbsp; Mark spoke to Nathan and explained he would need to configure printer to print the rx 4.25 x 5.5.&nbsp; I spoke to Nathan and he's under the impression he has the printer set up correctly.&nbsp; Logged into Lansing and viewed printer "Nursesouth", where 8.5 x 11 rx was printed.&nbsp; Printer settings were set to "Automatically Select" paper tray and paper was set to 8.5 x 11.&nbsp; Tried to set paper size to 4.25 x 5.5 without success.&nbsp; Spoke to Jake who set up virtual printer named "Nursesouth Rx" for testing purposes.&nbsp; Was able to reset tray and reset paper size to 4.25 x 5.5.&nbsp; Printed test rx - see second attachment for result.  </p>
