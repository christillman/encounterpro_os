<td class="sectionContent">
<OL> <LI class=numbers1>Open up Microsoft Access.  <br /> 
 <OL type=a> <LI class=numbers1>Open the database that you are wanting to add rooms too. </LI></OL> <LI class=numbers1>Open the o_rooms table. <br /> 
 <OL type=a> <LI class=numbers1>Start a new row by putting a room_id in.(ex. EXAM1)  <LI class=numbers1>Type a room description in the Room_name field. Please note that whatever you type here will display in encounterPRO. Also, that there is a character limit and if you put in a long name it may cut part of it off.  <LI class=numbers1>The next field is room_sequence. This will sort the rooms in encounterPRO. Ex. If Room 1 has a room_sequence of 3 and Room 2 has 1 then Room 2 will show in EncounterPRO before Room 1.  <LI class=numbers1>The next field is the room_type. Please enter in either $EXAMINATION or $TELEPHONE. Most rooms will use $EXAMINATION and $TELEPHONE is used for telephones rooms.  <LI class=numbers1>Room _status should be set to OK. 6. computer_id should be left blank unless you are wanting to set a coumputer to open with a default room. If this is the case you have to go into the o_computers table and get the computer_id for the computer you want to set.  <LI class=numbers1>Office_id is usually set to 0001 unless you have multiple offices. If you have multiple offices you can get the office_id from the c_office table.  <LI class=numbers1>Status is set to OK. (You need to add the room in o_groups to make it visible, see step 4 below.)  <br /> 
</LI></OL> <LI class=numbers1>Open the o_groups table (Only need to go in here if you are adding a new group)  <br /> 
 <OL type=a> <LI class=numbers1>This table will add a new group. Groups are the tabs on the right side of the application.  <LI class=numbers1>Group_id. Create a new id different from the ones that are already showing.  <LI class=numbers1>Description. what you type in this field will display in encounterPRO. There is a limit on character size. If you create a long description it will increase the size of the tabs causing it to cover part of the screen. Make sure you keep the names as small as possible.  <LI class=numbers1>Sort_sequence.  <br /> 
 <br /> 
<img src="images/content_note.gif" width="18" border="0"><FONT color=#009900><I>NOTE: The tabs are sorted in numerical order. You may have to change some of these around.  <br /> 
</I></FONT> <LI class=numbers1>Office_id is usually set to 0001 unless you have multiple offices. If you have multiple offices you can get the office_id from the c_office table.  <br /> 
</LI></OL> <LI class=numbers1>Open the o_group_room table.  <br /> 
 <OL type=a> <LI class=numbers1>You may have to look in the o_groups table and the o_rooms table for information to add to this table.  <LI class=numbers1>Group_id. This is the tab that you want to add this room too. This id can be obtained from the o_groups table.  <LI class=numbers1>Room_id. This is the room_id of the room you created earlier. You can obtain the room_id from the o_rooms table. <br /> 
</LI></OL> <LI>Go into encounterPRO and verify that the rooms and tabs are displaying the way that you intended. <br />
