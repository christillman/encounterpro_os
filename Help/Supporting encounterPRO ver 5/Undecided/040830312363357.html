<FONT face=Arial> <OL> <LI class=numbers1>Log in to the EHRI branded Intercall site at this url: <A href='http://livemeeting.com/cc/jmjtech'>http://livemeeting.com/cc/jmjtech</A>. </LI> <LI class=numbers1>Login using your assigned username and password. (if you do not have an assigned username and password please contact Technical Services for help.) If there is an emergency and your login has not been set, we have a default account setup. (Login ID: eprojmj Password: !$Epro&&)</LI> <LI class=numbers1>Select Schedule Meeting on the left nav bar.  The Schedule Meeting page appears. </LI> <LI class=numbers1>Enter the email addresses for all attendees. You can select Attendees to add users who have accounts setup in Intercall, or you can manually type email addresses here to invite attendees who do not have an account setup. You may also want to enter your email address so that you are sent an invitation to this meeting in case you lose your page or need a reference for other attendees with questions. </LI> <LI class=numbers1>Enter the email address(es) for the presenter(s).</LI> <LI class=numbers1>Enter a descriptive subject. This will appear on the email invitation and on the list of scheduled meetings.</LI> <LI class=numbers1>Select the Start date and time.</LI> <LI class=numbers1>Select the End date and time.</LI> <LI class=numbers1>Select the Time Zone that applies to the time in steps 7 and 8. (Default is Eastern Time.) Be sure you know whether or not the other users invited to your conference are in different time zones. </LI> <LI class=numbers1>Occurrence: This will allow you to setup a reoccurring meeting, and one time meeting, or an ongoing meeting. </LI> <LI class=numbers1>If the meeting is only an EHR person and one other location (one telephone connection), you should call directly (it is more cost effective). Proceed to step X. <br /> 
 <br /> 
If you will have more than one location connecting to the meeting, you will need to use the telphone conference (Intercall) service. Select the Enable telephone conferencing option. This button turns on the ability to have these users join a phone conference using our 866 (toll free) number you add in meeting options. </LI> <LI class=numbers1>Select the Meeting Options button. The Meeting Options screen appears.</LI> <LI class=numbers1>In the Meeting Details section, change the Meeting ID to something more easily remembered, if desired.</LI> <LI class=numbers1>Desktop Sharing, Technical Services recommends selecting High colors 16-bit on the drop down box.</LI> <LI class=numbers1>In the Entry Control, Presenters section select Entry Code and enter your own, easy to remember entry code.</LI> <LI class=numbers1>In the Entry Control, Attendees section select Entry Code and enter your own, easy to remember entry code or select Free Entry. </LI> <LI class=numbers1>Scroll down to the Audio section. Enter the following:</LI> <LI class=numbers1>Toll-free Number: 866-504-8260 </LI> <LI class=numbers1>(The Participant Code you enter on this screen MUST be your 10-digit conference ID. You cannot just make up a number.) If you do not have a personal Conference ID, use: 7709197213 (this will be referred to as the Reservation ID number for the participants when they log in to the conference.) </LI> <LI class=numbers1>If you do not have a personal Leader Pin, use: 0613 </LI> <LI class=numbers1>Conference Place Login: 3649803 </LI> <LI class=numbers1>Conference Place Password: 00613 </LI> <LI class=numbers1>Select OK.</LI> <LI class=numbers1> Message box: This will act as text in the body of the email invitation. </LI> <LI class=numbers1>Send Invitations button: This option just allows you to choose who the invited users receive their email invitation from. The default option generally works fine. You can choose to send the invitation from your email client, you will be given the information in a text box from which you can copy and paste the invitation in any email client, or message transmission medium that you choose. (IE. MSN messenger, hotmail, g-mail, etc.) </LI> <LI class=numbers1>After you have created this meeting, you will be presented with a Meeting details screen. This Screen displays the meeting information you have configured. From here you can join as the presenter, Join as attendee, Make updates to the meeting, Upload files, or modify the control panel. We do not have details on the upload file option for now. It requires 2 specific file types that tend to take longer than email to distribute. Also most of the time people use the Desktop sharing option that I will be getting to shortly for this reason. In the Meial received by the attendees</LI></OL>  <p> 
</FONT><FONT face=Arial>When you click the Join as Presenter button, you will be presented with a login screen from Microsoft Live Meeting.  (This may also prompt you to install some Java update and install a few tools and utilities to allow Windows Live Meeting to function properly. There is a button inside the emails sent to the attendees that will check the system to make sure all the proper utilities have been installed and that the machine is ready to attend the meeting.)  <br /> 
  <br /> 
   <br /> 
You will need the Meeting ID and the Entry code if you so defined in the Meeting options during the initial create a Meeting configuration. This information should have been emailed to everyone invited to the meeting.</FONT> </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT face=Arial>  <br /> 
Type your Display name and continue to the meeting. <br /> 
Upon connecting, you will be connected to the Lobby for the meeting. <br /> 
   <br /> 
  <br /> 
In the upper left hand corner there will be four to six drop down menus depending on your meeting rights. <br /> 
Content:  In this section, you can Share a specific program that you have running locally, Share your desktop so that everyone in the meeting can see what's happening locally on your machine.  (In a dual monitor environment, generally only the left monitor is shown.) You may also share a Whiteboard (similar to mspaint) or a Text page (similar to notepad). If there are multiple items being displayed by multiple individuals, you can select thumbnails and that will drop a list of all the items being displayed in the meeting. You can also lock users so that the content is only to be viewed by that user. <br /> 
Attendees:   This menu allows you to display all the current attendees in the meeting, invite someone by email for any reason. You can view the attendees in a list form or in a virtual seating chart. There is also a find option in this menu that allows you to search for attendees in case there are a large number of attendees. You may also dictate a quick set or permissions to users from this menu. <br /> 
Voice & Video:  allows users to enable/disable their video and voice options. <br /> 
 Q&A: Allows users to ask questions to presenters, and allows users to raise their hand to be next in line. <br /> 
Meeting: Displays the information specific to this meeting such as the meeting Id, the entry code, and the URL for that specific meeting. <br /> 
Recording:  Allows you to generate personal recordings from the meetings. <br /> 
To end the meeting, you click the Small drop down arrow in the top left hand corner. Click Exit and End the meeting to end the meeting for all attendees. Alternately, you can click Exit to leave the meeting.   <br />
