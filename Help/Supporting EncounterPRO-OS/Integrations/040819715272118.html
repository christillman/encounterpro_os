<FONT size=4>Real-time file creation <br /> </FONT>The simplest method of creating files to send to GRITS is to chart patients as usual.  EHR personnel will have reconfigured your immunization workplans to order a special observation called 'GRITS Vaccine Eligibility' whenever you order new vaccinations for a patient.  It is necessary to select the proper VFC eligibility code for the patient in the GRITS Vaccine Eligibility observation when it is ordered during the encounter in order to transmit the proper information to GRITS. <br /> 
 <br /> 
As you chart encounters and order vaccinations, data will automatically be appended to text files stored in your CPRFILES network share on your server.   Someone at your practice must undergo a manual process to send these files to GRITS via their secure web site. <br /> 
 <br /> 
These are the names of the files generated by the real-time GRITS report: </p>
 
 <BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style='MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px'>  <p> 
RLTME_CLNT.TXT <br /> 
RLTME_VACC.TXT </p>
 
</BLOCKQUOTE>  <p> 
<FONT size=4>Batch file creation <br /> </FONT>For reporting to GRITS the immunizations recorded before you went live with your GRITS integration, you may utilize the GRITS Batch report.  Also, if your EncounterPRO background services stop functioning, the real-time file creation for GRITS may fail to capture information from immunizations recorded while the background services were not running. <br /> 
 <br /> 
Running the GRITS Batch report is a very simple process.  In EncounterPRO, from the main office view, select the 'Utilities' tab from the list of tabs on the right.  From the menu that opens, select 'General Reports'.   Select the GRITS Batch report from the list.  Before the report executes, it will ask you for a date range.  Any immunizations recorded during the time specified will be included in the output of the report.  After you select your date range and click 'Finish', you will be presented with a list of available printers to use.  Please select the 'Default Printer' option.  EncounterPRO will stop responding for a few seconds or minutes while the GRITS data files are generated.  Once EncounterPRO starts responding again, your GRITS data files will have been placed in the CPRFILES network share on your server.  Someone at your practice must undergo a manual process to send these files to GRITS via their secure web site. <br /> 
 <br /> 
These are the names of the files generated by the GRITS Batch report: </p>
 
 <BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style='MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px'>  <p> 
BATCH_CLNT.TXT <br /> 
BATCH_VACC.TXT </p>
 
</BLOCKQUOTE>  <p> 
<FONT size=4>Sending the Results to GRITS <br /> </FONT>Grits recommends uploading data files on a daily basis.  Most EncounterPRO users upload to GRITS once a week. <br /> 
 <br /> 
<FONT size=3>Locate the GRITS Data Files <br /> </FONT>First, locate the GRITS data files that you need to upload to GRITS.  They are created in your CPRFILES network share on your server.  If you know the name of your server, you can get to the GRITS files by doing the following: <br /> 
 <br /> 
 </p>
 
 <OL> <LI class=numbers1>Click the Start button and select 'Run' from the menu.  <LI class=numbers1>In the text box, type: <br /> 
\\SERVERNAME\CPRFILES\GRITS <br /> 
Where SERVERNAME is the actual name of your server.<LI class=numbers1>Click OK.</LI></OL>  <p> 
If you have trouble, your local network administrator can assist you.  It is recommended that a shortcut be created pointing to the GRITS files on the desktop of whomever will be performing the GRITS uploads. </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT size=3>Log In to the GRITS Secure Site <br /> </FONT>Once your GRITS data files are located, proceed to the GRITS secure website to begin uploading your data. <br /> 
 <br /> 
The address for the GRITS secure website is: <br /> 
<A href='https://www.grits.state.ga.us/pls/gritsprod/security_ui.showLogin'>https://www.grits.state.ga.us/pls/gritsprod/security_ui.showLogin</A>. </p>
 
  <p> 
When you are performing an upload you will be prompted for the location of a pair of files: the client file and the immunization file.  To upload the batch report output, please enter the location of BATCH_CLIENT.TXT for the client file and BATCH_VACC.TXT for the immunization file.  To upload the real-time report output, please enter the location of RLTME_CLIENT.TXT for the client file and RLTME_VACC.TXT for the immunization file. <br /> 
 <br /> 
For specific information about the use of the GRITS secure website, please refer to your GRITS representative or to documentation provided by GRITS.  EHR, Inc. is not affiliated with GRITS and has no information about or control over the behavior of the GRITS secure website. </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT size=3>Cleaning up <br /> </FONT>After you have uploaded a file pair, please delete the files you have uploaded from the CPRFILES network share on your server.  If the files are not deleted after each upload, they will continue to grow, and uploads will take more time and cause duplicate records to be sent to GRITS.  GRITS can identify and ignore duplicate records, but there is a limit on the size of each upload, so deleting your GRITS files after each upload is an important step. </p>
