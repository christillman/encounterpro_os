Using Prime Time HPI (or Instant Medical History (IMH)) at a practice requires some additional configuration. The treatment workplan attached to the PrimeTime HPI treatment mode is called Primetime HPI. (It can be accessed by going to Configuration, Workplans, set Workplan Type to Treatment, search for Description contains primetime, set specialty to All, select the workplan, click Display/Edit.) This workplan needs to have three steps.

The treatment workplan attached to the PrimeTime HPI treatment mode is called Primetime HPI. </p>
 
  <p> 
To access Primetime HPI: <br /> 
1) Go to 'Configuration' and select 'Workplans'. <br /> 
2) Set 'Workplan Type' to 'Treatment', and search for 'Description' containing primetime. <br /> 
3) Set specialty to 'All', and select the workplan. <br /> 
4) Click 'Display/Edit'. </p>
 
  <p> 
This workplan needs to have three steps - <br /> 
1) Service External Source (PrimeTime HPI) ordered for Workplan Owner, flags set to OSPxxx with Service External Source Type of History with all other fields blank. <br /> 
2) Review - simply a treatment dashboard service (Review HPI) ordered for Workplan Owner, OSPxxx. <br /> 
3) Treatment, Other Observation - composite treatment, Primetime E and M Credit (ordered with Yes/No treatment mode), ordered for Workplan Owner, OSPxxx. </p>
 
  <p> 
Primetime E&M Credit Observation structure v2.0 Child treatments: <br /> 
HPI done in Primetime (one result, normal, - with E&M Credit for CC, HPI-Duration, Modifying facotrs, Signs and symptoms, and Timing). </p>
 
  <p> 
PFSH done in Primetime (one result, normal - with E&M Credit for all three PFSH bullets. </p>
 
  <p> 
These are standard, but at the practice's request, add ROS and/or break the PFSH down into Family, Social, and Medical histories. </p>
 
  <p> 
This allows the user to determine how much E&M credit depending on what the patient entered, which they just reviewed in the previous workplan step. If for some reason the HPI is ordered in error, not having the E&M credit automatically applied allows the user to click 'finished' without selecting the result (-) for any of the child observations and thus getting credit for that history. </p>
 
  <p> 
Varsion 1.0 - Objective, OBO|RRR|CBN, everything standard. The child is 'CC/ PM/ SOCIAL/ FAMILY' and is Subjective, has a perform result of 'Done in Primetime IMHx - see attachment' and has the following History coding elements: CC - Chief Complaint HPI - Duration, Modifying Facotrs, Signs and Symptoms, Timing PFSH - Family History, Past History, Social History. </p>
 
  <p> 
If the Quick View or Encounter SOAP Notes don't display the PrimeTime HPI, edit the Standard Quick View HPI Display script to include a Treatment Attachment command.  <br />
