To schedule an upgrade: </p>
 
  <p> 
1)&nbsp;Create a NEW issue for each Upgrade, assigning it to the appropriate upgrade owner, indicate what we are upgrading in the subject line. (i.e. Issue&nbsp;- Upgrade client, server and mod lvl OR Upgrade client to vs5.0.27, etc?) <br /> 
 <br /> 
2)&nbsp;Within the issue list what the practice is currently running. i.e. Encounterpro client version, server version and mod lvl. What the practice is currently running will determine how long this will take. <br /> 
 <br /> 
3)&nbsp;Check and note in issue how large cpr database is (check size of last backup, if there is no backup from the prior night this is a red flag) and also, how much free space is available on all hard drives. <br /> 
 <br /> 
4)&nbsp;Confirm with client how many fat clients they have that need to be upgraded. We will do ONLY one, provided we have access to the fat client. <br /> 
 <br /> 
5) Please make sure the practice understands that upgrading Fat clients are their responsibility. If they want us to upgrade their clients we will charge them. <br /> 
 <br /> 
6) Please send them the document (Manual EncounterPRO Client Upgrade Instructions located \\labserv2003\Common\Support\UpgradePacket\Build34) on how to upgrade their own fat clients. This is a generic document, so #4 will need to be tailored to the practice. (i.e. servernames change with each practice, locations of install files are not always in the same place) Update the issue if you send them this document so we are aware of what you told them ahead of time. <br /> 
 <br /> 
7)&nbsp;Go to 'JMJ Tools' and open 'Db Maintainence'. <br /> 
&nbsp; a) Verify database is in production, some upgrades require the database be in beta. (if you do not understand this please see me, it is important that the database be ready for a smooth transition)  <br /> 
&nbsp; b) Run 'Check Now'. <br /> 
 <br /> 
8)&nbsp;Ftp all installation files to db server's install/jmj folder. This will be the exact location the practice can find the installation files to upgrade their fat clients (#4 on Manual Encounterpro Client Upgrade Instructions) <br /> 
 <br /> 
9)&nbsp;List in issue why practice is getting an upgrade, ie. If it is to fix bugs GREAT, however if it is to resolve outstanding issues, please include those issue numbers in the upgrade issue.  <br /> 
 <br /> 
10)&nbsp;Schedule the upgrade on the 'Calendar' in 'Mailbox&nbsp;- EncounterPRO Support'. Remember to 'invite' the tech that will be performing the upgrade, so it is added to their calendar as well. All upgrades are free between the hours of 7am&nbsp;- 7pm EST. Outside of these hours we charge, speak with the Support Mgr about the particulars. <br /> 
<img src="images/content_note.gif" width="18" border="0"><FONT color=#009900><I>NOTES: <br /> 
1) An Upgrade is NOT a server move, more thought goes into a server move. <br /> 
2)&nbsp;Under no circumstances should we upgrade or reinstall encounterpro on a server without the practice's knowledge. <br /> 
3)&nbsp;Depending on where the practice is currently will determine how long it will take to upgrade them. Here are some estimates (these estimates do not include prep time you are required to perform as stated above):&nbsp; <br /> 
&nbsp; a) Client upgrades max 30 mins. <br /> 
&nbsp; b)&nbsp;Server upgrades max 30 mins.&nbsp; <br /> 
&nbsp; c)&nbsp;Mod lvl upgrades min 30 mins (usu approx 15 mins for each level).</I></FONT> </p>
