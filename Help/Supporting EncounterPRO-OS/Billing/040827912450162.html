'Canceled' Status <br /> 
There are 3 possible reasons for this: <br /> 
1) The encounter is not billable  <br /> 
2) The user selected 'hold'&nbsp; billing option. This causes the encounter set to 'non-billable' until they approve the billing.  <br /> 
3) User suspended the billing.  <br /> 
4) Billing component is not set for that encounter office in c_office table. </p>

Solution:
</td>
<td class="sectionContent">
To unsuspend billing, for 'Canceled' Status, recheck in patient and then exit encounter and it will prompt you to unsuspend the bill. Select 'Yes' to unsuspend bill and re-post the encounter. If the status is completed most of the times a valid bill must be generated and send out. In case they completed the todo item [the popup will ask again whether they want to release the bill now or cancel] and didn't allow the billing to go, then it will never sent the bill and always 'complete' the service with all the re-post requests.

'Canceled' Status <br /> 
To unsuspend billing: <br /> 
1) Recheck in patient and then exit encounter and it will prompt you to unsuspend the bill. <br /> 
2) If you select 'Yes' it will unsuspend the bill. <br /> 
3) You will then have to re-post the encounter. </p>
 
  <p> 
'Completed' Status <br /> 
If the status is completed most of the times a valid bill must be generated and send out. If it didn't then there is ONLY ONE possible reason for that. The encounter owner must have chosen 'suspend the bill' [find a encounter progress record send_billing_suspended ='T'] and there must be an item on his/her todo box to complete the chart. In case they completed the todo item [the popup will ask again whether they want to release the bill now or cancel] and didn't allow the billing to go, then it will never sent the bill and always 'complete' the service with all the re-post requests. </p>
