Depending on your practice's preference and the configuration of your workplans, the clinical staff can document vitals, histories, lab results, etc. When this is the case, the provider's workflow will generally begin with a review of this information.  <br /> 
 </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> 
</FONT>Your practice may not have the Quick View screens enabled. This is a configuration setting. If you want to use the Quick View screens, contact EHR Product Support and schedule a consultation. <br />

<OL> 
<LI class=numbers1>Depending on your configuration and workplans, the first service bar for the provider will be one of the following:  <br /> 
 
<UL> 
<LI class=bullets1>Preview Report  
<LI class=bullets1>Quick View Preview or Summary  
<LI class=bullets1>Examination Select the service bar  <br /> 
</LI></UL> 
<LI class=numbers1><EM>If you selected the Preview Report service bar</EM>, the Preview Report screen appears. This report lists all the information collected by the clinical staff during today's encounter. When finished reviewing this information, select Finished. The Patient Chart appears.  <br /> 
 
<LI class=numbers1><EM>If you selected the Quick View Preview or Summary</EM>, the Quick View screen appears. This report also displays information collected by the clinical staff during today's encounter as well as open assessments and other information such as immunization status.  <br /> 
 <br /> 
The headings on the Quick View screen are 'hot,' that is, you can select one to navigate to the data entry screen for that item. For example, select the heading for Vitals to open the Vitals screen and make any corrections or enter a new set of vital signs. You can use the Quick View screen to navigate to most areas of the system, ordering assessments and treatments as well as reviewing previously entered information. When finished, select Finished. The Patient Chart appears.  <br /> 
 
<LI class=numbers1><EM>If you selected Examination</EM>, the Patient Chart appears. The information from today's encounter appears in blue, while previously entered information appears in black. You can also select the New Only button to hide the old information.  <br /> 
 <br /> 
The Patient Chart shows the first three lines of information for each history or treatment. If you see an item with a&nbsp;<STRONG>... </STRONG>notation, there is more information than can be displayed on the Patient Chart. Select the description for that item to display the dashboard screen and review the complete information.  <br />
