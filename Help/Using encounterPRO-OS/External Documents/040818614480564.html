In some practices, the scanning and posting tasks may be done by different staffers. This allows one person to scan in bulk (see <A href='040817710310255.html'>How to: Scan and Post Multiple Items</A>) while other staffers determine which patients and treatments the documents are associated with.  <br /> 
 </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> 
</FONT>Posting can be done from any workstation, while scanning must be done from the workstation physically connected to the scanner. <br />

<FONT size=4>Steps <br /> 
</FONT>Follow the steps below: <br /> 
<EM><FONT color=#6600ff>To Post a Previously Scanned Attachment to an Outstanding Treatment:</FONT></EM> </p>
 
 <OL> <LI class=numbers1>From the Utilities list, select the appropriate Outstanding Treatment button (Outstanding Labs & Tests, Outstanding Referrals, etc.). A list of outstanding labs, test, or other treatments appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the item you want to post the attachment to from the list. You may have to filter or search by patient name. The Treatment dashboard screen appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the Attachments tab.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the Star (New) button. A list of External Sources appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select encounterPRO Attachment as the External Source. The Attachments screen appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the To Be Posted tab. A list of all previously scanned, but unposted attachments appears. Select the item you want to preview from the list on the left. A thumbnail version (preview) appears in the white box on the right. Confirm that this is the item you want to attach to the current treatment.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the Select button. The system will ask if you want to remove the item from the To-Be-Posted list. In most cases, the answer will be Yes. If this is an item you want to post to more than one treatment or more than one patient, select No to leave it in the To Be Posted list.  <LI class=numbers1>You may be prompted to select a folder for this attachment. Select a folder from the list on the right, then OK.  <LI class=numbers1>Depending on the folder selected, an Attachment Workplan screen may appear. (Folders can have workplans attached that are automatically launched when an item is saved to that folder.)  <br /> 
 <br /> 
If you want to launch the workplan (very important if this is a lab integration practice), select Finished. If you do not want to launch the workplan, select No Workplan This Time. A bar appears with the name of the attachment (defaulted from the treatment) and the date attached.  <br /> 
 <LI class=numbers1>Select Finished save the attachment and return to the Outstanding Treatments list.</LI></OL>  <p> 
<EM><FONT color=#6600ff>To Post a Previously Scanned Attachment from the Scanned/Post list: <br /> 
</FONT></EM> </p>
 
 <OL> <LI class=numbers1>From the Utilities list, select Scan/Post Images button. The Items to be Posted list appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the item you want to preview from the list on the left. A thumbnail version (preview) appears in the white box on the right. Confirm that this is the item you want to post.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the Post button at the bottom of the screen. The Patient Search screen appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Enter the search criteria for the patient you want to post this attachment to. Select the patient from the list of matching patients. The Posting screen appears.  <LI class=numbers1>If you want to remove the item from the To-Be-Posted list select Yes (the default) under Remove from Previous Folder. If this is an item you want to post to more than one treatment or more than one patient, select No to leave it in the To Be Posted list.  <LI class=numbers1>Select a folder for this attachment from the list on the right, then select OK. If the folder selected was a patient-context folder (such as Patient Information or Insurance Information, etc.) then the item is saved in that folder and the Items To Be Posted list reappears.  <LI class=numbers1>If the folder was a treatment-context folder (such as Lab Reports, Encounter Records, Radiology Reports, etc.) then you must attach the document to a specific treatment. A screen appears with a list of existing treatments on the left and Post to New Treatment fields on the right.  <LI class=numbers1>If the treatment you want to post the document to appears on the list on the left, select the item and select Post to Treatment. The item is saved and attached to that treatment and the Items To Be Posted screen reappears. If the treatment does not appear in the list on the left, you will need to order a new treatment:  <br /> 
 <OL type=a> <LI class=numbers1>Be sure the treatment type is correct  <LI class=numbers1>Select the gray box next to Select Treatment. A Select Treatment screen appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the appropriate treatment from the short list or use the search options to locate it.  <LI class=numbers1>Select OK. The treatment appears in the Description box.  <LI class=numbers1>If the treatment has a specific begin date from the lab order or noted on the document, select the appropriate begin date.  <LI class=numbers1>Select New Treatment. The treatment is ordered and the document is attached. This treatment will appear in the Patient Chart. The item is saved and the Items To Be Posted screen reappears.  <br /> 
</LI></OL> <LI class=numbers1>Repeat steps 2 - 8 to post additional items from the list. If you want to post another item to the previous patient, you can select that patient name at the bottom of the screen instead of selecting the Post button and searching for the patient.  <LI class=numbers1>When done posting, select OK to return to the Utilities list.</LI></OL>  <p>
