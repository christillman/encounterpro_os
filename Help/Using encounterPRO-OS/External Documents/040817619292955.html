<FONT size=4>Purpose <br /> </FONT>If you are scanning paper documents, such as lab reports and items that were not ordered through EncounterPRO, you can post them to folders within the patient's chart. Items that go with treatments and assessments ordered through EncounterPRO should be posted directly to that open treatment or assessment. See  <a href="040818220341614.html"> How to: Post a File Directly to an Assessment</a> and  <a href="040817911002884.html"> How to: Post Documents to a Treatment</a> for those instructions. <br /> 
 <br /> 
This solution assumes that the documents have already been scanned. See  <a href="040817710310255.html"> How to: Scan and Post Multiple Items</a> for instructions on scanning documents. <br /> 
 </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> </FONT>Your folders should be configured and you should know into which folders you will be posting the documents. </p>
 
  <p> 
Posting from a Non-Scanning Station <br /> 
If you have a user or group posting the scanned items to the patient's chart, they may be using a station that is not connected to the scanner. In this case, you will need to configure each station that will be used for posting items as follows: <br /> 
 </p>
 
 <OL> <LI class=numbers1>From the Office view, select the Configuration tab. The Configuration list appears. The options available depend on your security access rights.  <LI class=numbers1>Select External Sources. The External Sources screen appears.  <LI class=numbers1>The computer you are currently using is highlighted on the list on the left. Any External Sources configured for this station appear highlighted on the list on the right.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the bar for EncounterPRO Attachment if it is not already selected.  <LI class=numbers1>Select Finished.</LI></OL>

<FONT size=4>Steps <br /> </FONT>Follow the steps below: </p>
 
 <OL> <LI class=numbers1>From the Utilities List, select Scan/Post Images. The Import and Post Attachments screen appears. The list on the left shows all the scanned items that have not yet been posted to a patient's chart.  <LI class=numbers1>Select an item from the list on the left. A preview of the item appears in the gray box on the right.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the Post button. The Patient Search screen appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Enter the search criteria to locate the patient into whose chart you want to post this document.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the patient name bar. A screen appears with a list of folders on the right.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the folder appropriate for the document you are posting.  <LI class=numbers1>Select whether or not you want to remove the document from the previous folder (the unposted list). Do not remove the item from the previous folder if you want to post this same item to another folder.  <LI class=numbers1>Select OK. Depending on the folder you chose, you may be prompted to tie the document to a specific treatment, encounter, or other item. A list of open items appears on the left of the screen. If the document corresponds with an item in the list on the left, select the item and Post button. If the document does not correspond with an item in the list, complete the information on the right side of the screen to create a new item, then select New.  <br /> 
 <br /> 
For example, if you select the folder Encounter Records, then you will be prompted to tie the document to an existing encounter or create a new encounter. The document is now located in the folder you chose. <br /> 
 <LI class=numbers1>The patient name appears on the Import and Post screen at the bottom.  <LI class=numbers1>To post additional documents from the unposted list to this same patient, select the item, then select the patient name bar. Repeat steps 6 - 9.  <LI class=numbers1>To post documents to a different patient's chart, repeat steps 2 - 9.  <LI class=numbers1>When done posting, select OK. The Utilities list reappears. Select Exit to return to the Office view.</LI></OL>  <p>
