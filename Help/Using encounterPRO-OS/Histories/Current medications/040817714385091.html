The Current Medications screen can be configured into the clinical staff's workflow to ensure that medications are updated for each visit. Medications noted in previous visits and those ordered by the provider appear automatically on the Current Meds screen. Add new medications&nbsp;as needed or close medications which have been discontinued to keep the list up to date. See  <a href="040817715135384.html"> How to: Close a Discontinued Medication</a> for instructions on closing. <br /> 
 </p>
 
 
 <p> 
<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> </FONT>You will want to add as much detail about the medications the patient is taking as possible. Some patients will not know the drug package, strength or dosage. When that occurs, you can still add the drug to the list, even if all you know is the name of the drug. If you later find out more information, you can remove the "placeholder" entry and add the medication with all the information. <br />
