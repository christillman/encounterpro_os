<FONT size=4>Description</FONT> </p>
 
  <p> 
When a document has been ordered, it will appear on the Document Management screen. The screen can be accessed from the Patient Chart, from the treatment room, or from certain menus. Depending on the button used to access the screen, the screen will display the documents for that treatment only, all documents for the current encounter, or all documents for that patient. <br /> 
 <br /> 
Choosing the Recipient <br /> 
The recipients available depend on the document purpose, document configuration, and the recipient/routes purchased. <br /> 
encounterPRO will default the recipient based on the following rules: <br /> 
 </p>
 
 <UL>
 
<LI class=bullets1>If a document of this specific type (context + object) has been previously ordered, that recipient defaults. A specific type would be a prescription for the same drug. 
 
<LI class=bullets1>If no document of this purpose was previously ordered, then the recipient designated as the Primary for this recipient type/specialty on the Care Team list defaults. A purpose could be NewRX or Referral letter. 
 
<LI class=bullets1>If no Primary recipient has been designated, then the system picks the first recipient (top) on the Care Team of the specified recipient type.</LI></UL> <P class=bullets1>If the default recepient is not the desired recipient, then the user can select the recipient bar and select from the available recipient types. </p>
 
  <p> 
Choosing the Route <br /> 
After the recipient is selected, the system displays the routes (channels) available. Common routes include: </p>
 
 <UL>
 
<LI class=bullets1>Printer 
 
<LI class=bullets1>Secure Email <FONT color=#ff0000>* </FONT>
 
<LI class=bullets1>Fax 
 
<LI class=bullets1>E-prescribing <FONT color=#ff0000>* </FONT>
 
<LI class=bullets1>Mail ("snail" mail) <FONT color=#ff0000>*</FONT></LI></UL>  <p> 
<FONT color=#ff0000>* </FONT>Routes will be made available as subscription services, such as e-prescribing via SureScripts-RxHub. <br /> 
 <br /> 
Viewing the Document <br /> 
If you want to review the document before sending it, select the View button for that document. <br /> 
 <br /> 
Status of the Document <br /> 
The Status bar shows the current state of the document: </p>
 
 <UL>
 
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Ordered</STRONG>&nbsp;- most documents will show a Status of Ordered when the Document Management screen is first displayed. If the document was configured to Print Now, then the Status of Ordered will not be visible. 
 
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Created</STRONG>&nbsp;- if the user Viewed or Edited the document, the Status will show as Created. The document has not been dispatched yet. 
 
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Sent/Printed</STRONG>&nbsp;- depending on the route selected, the Status will be Sent or Printed. If a document is configured to Print Now, the Status will show as Sent or Printed automatically very soon after the document was ordered. 
 
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Completed</STRONG>&nbsp;- if the document was sent electronically, encounterPRO can receive messages indicating that the document was received. The Status will show as Complete. Once the Status shows as Completed, the document cannot be re-sent or edited. 
 
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Cancelled</STRONG> </LI></UL>  <p> 
Other Options <br /> 
There are several other options you can perform on a document: </p>
 
 <UL>
 
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Edit</STRONG>&nbsp;- displays the dashboard for the treatment or object that the document pertains to 
 
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Re-send -</STRONG>&nbsp;if the document was not sent successfully, the user can choose to re-send it 
 
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Cancel</STRONG>&nbsp;- if the document was not yet sent or was not sent successfully, the user can choose to cancel it. (If the document has a status of Completed, it cannot be canceled here).</LI></UL>  <p> 
Sending the Document <br /> 
When you are satisfied with the document, the recipient and route have been chosen then the document can be dispatched to the printer or electronic route. The button text will show Print or Send, depending on the route selected. Select the Send or Print button. <br />
