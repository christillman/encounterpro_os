<FONT size=4>Purpose</FONT> <br /> 
When a patient is being seen for a well visit there will be times when you also want to bill a sick assessment. Perhaps the patient has a chronic problem such as asthma or hypertension that you enter a progress note for or change their treatment plan during the well encounter. Or you may have children coming in for a check-up who also have a minor illness. <br /> 
 </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> 
</FONT>The patient should be checked in as a Well Encounter (either New or Established patient). The clinical staff will perform their steps as usual, documenting the Chief Complaint (CC) and History or Present Illness (HPI) as a Well Child Visit. <br /> 
The provider will need to adjust the billing after completing the documentation in order to bill for both the well visit and the sick assessment. <br />

<FONT size=4>Steps <br /> 
</FONT>Follow the steps below: <br /> 
<EM><FONT color=#6600ff>To Document the Chief Complaint and HPI: <br /> 
</FONT></EM> </p>
 
 <OL> <LI class=numbers1>For the sick complaint, the clinical staff can document the information using the Chief Complaint pick list or by entering it the Chief Complaint box.  <LI class=numbers1>The HPI for today's complaints can be documented by either the clinical staff or the provider. This is dependent no your practice's general business practices. The typical workflow for a well visit doesn't include the HPI screens, so the HPI will need to be ordered manually.  <LI class=numbers1>If the clinical staff documents the HPI, then: <br /> 
 <OL type=a> <LI class=numbers1>From the Patient Chart, select Pick H & P (you may have to select Other Items first).  <LI class=numbers1>Select Pick CC/HPI. The Select History, CC, and HPI screen appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the HPI appropriate to today's complaint, or select General HPI for a more general set of observations.  <LI class=numbers1>Select OK. The HPI screen appears. Enter the information about today's illness, then select Finished. </LI></OL> <br /> 
The Patient Chart reappears.  <br /> 
 <LI class=numbers1>If the Provider will document the HPI, then:  <br /> 
 <OL type=a> <LI class=numbers1>If your workflow includes Quick View screens, you can select the CC/HPI section title to display the CC/HPI screen. Alternatively, from the Patient Chart, select Pick H & P (you may have to select Other Items first).  <LI class=numbers1>Select Pick CC/HPI. The Select History, CC, and HPI screen appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the HPI appropriate to today's complaint, or select General HPI for a more general set of observations.  <LI class=numbers1>Select OK. The HPI screen appears. Enter the information about today's illness, then select Finished. </LI></OL> <br /> 
The Patient Chart or Quick View screen reappears.</LI></OL>  <p> 
<EM><FONT color=#6600ff>To Order the Assessments:</FONT></EM> </p>
 
 <OL> <LI class=numbers1>Order the Well assessment as you normally would.  <br /> 
<FONT color=#00cc00><img src="images/content_note.gif" width="18" border="0"><FONT color=#009900><EM>NOTE: The provider should always order the well assessment </I>first.</EM></FONT></FONT> <br /> 
</I> <LI class=numbers1>For the sick complaint, you can either select a new sick assessment or update an existing sick assessment.  <LI class=numbers1>To order a new sick assessment, select New Sick DX from the Patient Chart. The Select Sick Assessment screen appears.  <br /> 
 <OL type=a> <LI class=numbers1>Select an assessment from the short list or search for the desired assessment(s).  <LI class=numbers1>Select OK. A treatment list appears for each sick assessment selected.  <LI class=numbers1>Order the desired treatments then select Finished.  <br /> 
</LI></OL> <LI class=numbers1>To update an existing sick assessment, locate that assessment on the Patient Chart. Select the description for the assessment. The assessment dashboard appears.

 <OL> <LI class=numbers1>From the Patient Chart, select Exit. The Billing Review screen appears. The visit code reflects the well encounter visit code. Both the sick and well assessment should be displayed.  <LI class=numbers1>Click on the large gray box on the right side of the Billing screen. The second Billing screen appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select New Secondary Visit Charge. A list of secondary visit codes appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Choose the appropriate Established or New patient exam code from the list. This will include the (-25) modifier. The new Secondary Visit CPT code appears with the (-25) modifier. Notice that both diagnoses are listed under each CPT code.  <LI class=numbers1>After you have both the well encounter visit code and the modifier -25 code displayed, you must associate the appropriate ICD-9 codes for each assessment with the appropriate CPT code.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the bar for the Well visit code (should be the top bar). A menu of options will display.  <LI class=numbers1>Select Attach to Diagnosis. A list of billable assessments for this encounter appears.  <LI class=numbers1>The well assessment(s) should be highlighted. Select any sick assessments that are currently highlighted (darkened) to de-select those.  <LI class=numbers1>Select OK. The Billing screen reappears. Only the ICD-9 codes for the well assessments should appear under the Well Visit code.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the bar for the Secondary Visit Code (see step 4). A menu of options appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select Attach to Diagnosis. A list of billable assessments for this encounter appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select any well assessment(s) that are currently highlighted (darkened) to de-select them .  <LI class=numbers1>Select OK. The Billing screen reappears. Only the ICD-9 codes for the sick assessments should appear under the bar for the modifier code.  <LI class=numbers1>Select Finished. The corrected Billing Review screen appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Confirm that the codes are matched up appropriately, then select I'm Finished to complete the encounter.</LI></OL>  <p>
