<FONT size=4>Purpose</FONT> <br /> 
It is important to associate a treatment with the assessment(s) that it is intended to treat. Among other reasons, this allows you to: </p>
 
 <UL>
 
<LI class=bullets1>Assign billable treatments to the appropriate assessment in the billing 
 
<LI class=bullets1>Produce an assessment history that contains all the previously ordered treatments for a specific assessment 
 
<LI class=bullets1>Easily locate the treatments you want to review or close in the Patient Chart 
 
<LI class=bullets1>Quickly close the associated treatments when you close the assessment</LI></UL>  <p> 
<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> </FONT>Treatments that are ordered by the clinical staff are often not associated with any assessment. For example, if the clinical staff orders a rapid strep test or urinalysis before the provider sees the patient, those items would not be associated with any assessment. <br /> 
 <br /> 
The EncounterPRO billing program attempts to reduce billing errors by matching any billable treatment that does not have an associated assessment with the first assessment selected by the provider for billing purposes only. However, the lab or other treatment might not belong with that assessment and needs to be manually assigned to the correct assessment in order to fully leverage the EHR's capabilities listed above. <br />

<FONT size=4>Steps <br /> </FONT>This procedure assumes that the treatment has already been ordered outside the assessment's treatment list. Follow the steps below: </p>
 
 
<OL> 
<LI class=numbers1>From the Patient Chart, locate the treatment that you want to associate with one or more assessments. It may be near the top of the text area under the heading Treatments with No Assessment.  
<LI class=numbers1>Select the description of the treatment. The treatment dashboard screen appears.  
<LI class=numbers1>Select the Assessments tab. A list of open assessments appears.  
<LI class=numbers1>Select the assessments that this treatment should be associated with. You can select more than one assessment if that treatment is intended for multiple assessments.  
<LI class=numbers1>Select the Billing tab. The list of charges for this treatment and the associated assessments appears. Confirm that the charge is highlighted (darkened) and the associated assessments are also highlighted (darkened).  
<LI class=numbers1>Select Finished to return to the Patient Chart. The treatment should now appear below the assessment(s) you selected in step 4.</LI></OL>
