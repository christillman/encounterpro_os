Note that when you select I'm Finished on the Billing Review screen, it signals that the provider is finished with the patient. If there are no pending services for this patient, such as vaccinations or other treatments, the patient is sent to the Checkout Room and the billing charges are exported to the billing system. <br /> 
 <br /> 
If you select I'll Be Back the patient will remain in the exam room and no billing information will be sent to the billing system. Selecting I'll Finish Later sends the patient to checkout (providing there are no services pending) and allows the provider to postpone sending the charges to billing. A Task will be sent to the provider's Task list for easy access. Upon completion, the user will be prompted to send the billing charges at that time. <br />

<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> 
</FONT>The billing information will not be sent to your integrated PMS until the patient has reached the Checkout Room. Leaving a patient in a Holding or Chart Room or Billing Approval Room has it's advantages in allowing a thorough review of the billing before approval, however, it requires the office personnel to be diligent about clearing out those rooms every night. <br />

<P class=numbers1> 
<UL> 
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Select I'm Finished</STRONG> to signal that the provider is finished with the patient. If there are no pending services for this patient, such as vaccinations or other treatments, the patient is sent to the Checkout Room and the billing charges are exported to the billing system.  
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Select I'll Be Back</STRONG>. The patient will remain in the exam room and no billing information will be sent to the billing system. If the patient is no longer in the exam room, you may want to move them to a holding room or other staging area. See <A href="../../Encounters/040817912090552.html">How to: Move a Patient from One Room to Another</A>.  
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Select I'll Finish Later</STRONG> to send the patient to Checkout (providing there are no services pending). The provider has the option to send the billing information now or send later. Selecting Send Billing Now lets the provider finish charting clinical information later, while sending the billing information immediately. Selecting Send Later allows additional charges to be added. A Task will be sent to the provider's Task list for easy access to that encounter. Upon completion, the user will be prompted to send the billing charges at that time if they did not send them earlier.</LI></UL>
