Most practices will have two main categories of labs and tests:  <br /> 
 <UL>
 
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>In house -</STRONG> those labs and tests collected and analyzed in house. For in house items, the specimens are collected on site and the results are entered by the nurse. 
 
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Send out -</STRONG> those labs and tests where the specimen is collected and sent to an external facility or the patient is referred to an external facility for both collection and analysis. For send out items, only the collect service bar appears for the nurse to note whether the specimen was collected or the patient referred out.</LI></UL>  <p>

<FONT size=4>Steps <br /> 
</FONT>Follow the steps below: <br /> 
<EM><FONT color=#6600ff>To Enter Results for In House Labs and Tests: <br /> 
</FONT></EM>If an in house lab was ordered during the encounter, service bars will be created for both the collection and entry of results. You can see and select these service bars from the Office view. </p>
 
 <OL> <LI class=numbers1>Select the treatment room where the patient is currently waiting.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the service bar for the specific lab you are working on. Normally the first service bar is a collect specimen service.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the Collected option, then select Finished. A second service bar appears to allow you to enter results for the lab.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the Enter Results service bar. The Lab Results screen appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Enter each result in the appropriate observation. When finished, select Done.</LI></OL>  <p> 
<EM><FONT color=#6600ff>To Enter Results for Send Out Labs and Tests: <br /> 
</FONT></EM>Labs and tests that are sent to an external provider are handled differently from the in house labs. A collected service bar appears, but no service bar is created for results, since it may be some time before the results can be entered. These items will appear on the Outstanding Labs and Tests list. </p>
 
 <OL> <LI class=numbers1>When the results of the lab or test are received, select the Utilities tab on the Office view. The Utilities list appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the Outstanding Labs/Test button. The Outstanding Labs/Tests screen appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Locate the specific lab or test you want to enter results for. You can sort the list by patient name, type of test, or ordering provider. Select the Patient Name bar or the lab/test name. The treatment dashboard screen for the lab/test appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Click on colored name of the lab or test. The treatment dashboard screen appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the colored lab name. The results entry screen appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Enter the lab/test results, then select Finished. The treatment dashboard reappears.  <LI class=numbers1>When finished entering the results, you can send a Tasks to the provider to review the results, if needed. <br /> 
 <OL type=a> <LI class=numbers1>Select the Other Options button.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the Task button.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the Provider you want to receive this Task.  <LI class=numbers1>Enter any additional information in the Message area.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the Send button. </LI></OL>  <p> 
<img src="images/content_note.gif" width="18" border="0"><FONT color=#009900><I>NOTE: The Lab/Test results will now be in the selected provider's Task list as a patient-related Tasks.  <br /> 
</I></FONT> <br /> 
 </p>
 
 <LI class=numbers1>If no further information will be coming in the future for this lab/test and you do not plan to attach a scanned image to this item, select the Close Treatment button or <CLOSE>link. This removes the item from the Outstanding Labs/Tests screen.  <br /> 
 <br /> 
<img src="images/content_tip.gif" width="18" border="0"><I><FONT color=#0000ff>TIP: Your office should decide which user should close the labs and tests. Some practices prefer for the staff entering the results to close the treatment, others prefer to have the provider review the results and then close the item. It is important that someone in the office close out these items as they are completed, otherwise they remain on the Outstanding Labs/Tests list. </FONT></I> <br /> 
 <LI class=numbers1>Select Finished. The Outstanding Labs/Tests screen reappears.</LI></OL>  <p>
