<FONT size=4>Purpose <br /> 
</FONT>Your practice will configure its labs and tests to indicate which are send out and which are done in house. In house labs and tests will create collection and entry of results service bars for the appropriate staff member when ordered. The procedure for ordering labs, tests, x-rays and other tests is similar. <br /> 
 </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> 
</FONT>Will this lab or test be processed in the office or sent out? <br /> 
You can order labs and other treatments without an assessment, however, you will then need to manually associate the treatment to the correct assessment later in order for the billing to be accurate. <br />
