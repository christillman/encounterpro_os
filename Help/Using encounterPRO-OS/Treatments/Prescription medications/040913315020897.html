 <p> 
<FONT color=#0000ff><STRONG>What if I want to send all my encounter and patient reports to Document Manager?</STRONG> </FONT> </p>
 
 
 <p> 
Whether or not a report is routed to the printer or sent to Document Manager is determined by how the report is ordered.&nbsp; When Document Manager is 'turned on' the default for all EPRO Report services is to send treatment report documents (Prescriptions, Referral letters, etc.) to Document Manager rather than directly to a printer. If the practice would like to set up other menu buttons or links to use the Document Manager option, that can be accomplished as well. It is recommended that you set up a separate menu to Print Reports and Order Documents so that the users will recognize which buttons will have which outcome. </p>
 
 
 <p> 
<FONT color=#0000ff><STRONG>How do I know which local pharmacies accept electronic prescriptions?&nbsp;Are pharmacies in my area ready to communicate with me electronically? </STRONG></FONT> </p>
 
 
 <p> 
Over 70% of community pharmacies in the U.S. are accepting e-prescriptions, and more are connecting every day. EHRI downloads the list of SureScripts-enabled pharmacies to your practice in the nightly maintenance job run by EncounterPRO. Pharmacies are now activated for e-prescribing nationwide. SureScripts now provides a Pharmacy Search where you can generate a list&nbsp;of pharmacies enabled for e-prescribing in your area.  </p>
 
 
 <p> 
<STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff>How will I know when I can start sending prescriptions via SureScripts? </FONT></STRONG> </p>
 
 
 <p> 
Providers should be able to start using SureScripts to send new prescriptions 1-2 days after registering. SureScripts member pharmacies are expected to download the provider list each night. A specific pharmacy needs to download the updated provider list successfully in order for a new provider to send a prescription to that specific pharmacy. If for some reason the nightly download was unsuccessful, the provider will not be able to send a prescription to that specific pharmacy, but could send&nbsp; the prescription to a different pharmacy whose list was successfully updated. To be sure that the pharmacy in question has updated their provider list, the practice can call and ask the pharmacy to check their registered providers list. </p>
 
 
 <p> 
<STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff>How do I know if the prescription was sent successfully to the pharmacy?</FONT></STRONG> </p>
 
 
 <p> 
There is an option for your practice to receive success message in addition to the failure messages that are routed to the ordering provider's Task List. Additionally, a user can check the Document Management screen for the treatment in question and check the status of the document. If the status reads, "Confirmed" then the prescription should have been received by the pharmacy. If the status reads, "Error" please check your Task list for a more descriptive failure message. </p>
 
 
 <p> 
<FONT color=#0000ff><STRONG>What should I do if I receive an error message that my electronic prescription didn't go to the pharmacy? </STRONG></FONT> </p>
 
 
 <p> 
There are several reasons a prescription might not be received at the pharmacy: </p>
 
 
 <p> 
If the electronic prescription did not go to the pharmacy because the pharmacy is not enabled to accept electronic prescriptions, it will automatically be sent by fax. Depending upon the urgency of the prescription, you may want to call the pharmacy. You should also contact EHRI Product Support to report the error.  </p>
 
 
 <p> 
If the prescription was for a controlled substance, it will be rejected by SureScripts and the ordering provider will receive a Task that the prescription failed. Controlled substances cannot be sent electronically. </p>
 
 
 <p> 
Refer to the Troubleshooting e-Prescribing document for more details. </p>
 
 
 <p> 
<STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff>How will I know if pharmacies are properly loaded in my system?</FONT></STRONG> </p>
 
 
 <p> 
EncounterPRO downloads the list of SureScripts-enabled pharmacies&nbsp;nightly during the EncounterPRO maintenance job so that your practice has the most up-to-date list possible. When searching for a pharmacy in EncounterPRO, you can search by Name or by ZIP code. Search for pharmacies in your ZIP code(s) to see a list of the SureScripts-enabled pharmacies downloaded to your site. </p>
 
 
 <p> 
<STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff>What happens if the patient is not matched in the system when a pharmacy sends a renewal request?</FONT></STRONG> </p>
 
 
 <p> 
Each e-Refill request is matched to a patient and existing prescription medication treatment. If EncounterPRO cannot match the request to a specific patient and treatment, the request goes to the To Be Posted list on the Utilities list.  </p>
 
 
 <p> 
<STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff>How can I cover for my collegues when they are out of the office and under whose name will the prescriptions be sent to the pharmacy?</FONT></STRONG> </p>
 
 
 <p> 
When an e-Refill request is matched to a patient/treatment, EncounterPRO sends a Task to the provider who last ordered the medication treatment to approve or deny the refill request. If that provider is out of the office for an extended period, the practice manager can forward those Tasks to another SureScripts provider's list. The prescriptions that are approved will show the name of the provider who approved the refill. </p>
 
 
 <p> 
<STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff>How does the system handle controlled substance prescriptions and pharmacy renewal requests for controlled substances?</FONT></STRONG> </p>
 
 
 <p> 
Controlled substances are currently not permitted to be filled electronically per DEA regulations. If a provider orders a controlled substance, SureScripts will not be an available route.  <br /> 
Some pharmacies will continue to send refill requests for controlled substances by fax. Prescriptions for Schedule II drugs can never be sent electronically. Hand-signed hard copies of prescriptions for Schedule III through V drugs can be sent using manual fax technologies. Neither computer-generated faxes containing electronic signatures nor totally electronic prescriptions for controlled substances can be sent to pharmacies at this time. </p>
 
 
 <p> 
<STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff>Can my NPs and PAs sign up for SureScripts?</FONT></STRONG> </p>
 
 
 <p> 
In cases where the extenders (NPs and PAs) are RX-certified, they can register as SureScripts users and send prescriptions electronically. The user must have a valid NPI number. <br /> 
 </p>
 
 
 <p> 
<STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff>When I ordered the medication, EncounterPRO displayed an 'Error ordering document' message. What does this mean?</FONT></STRONG> </p>
 
 
 <p> 
The error message is caused by the wrong version of a SQL function.&nbsp; Contact EHRI Product Support and they can repair the function by running 'DB Scripts 141.sql' and then rerunning all hotfixes. </p>
 
 
 <p> 
<STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff>I tried to order a medication and it went directly to the printer and did not appear on the Document Manager screen. What happened?</FONT></STRONG> </p>
 
 
 <p> 
There are two common reasons for this:  <br /> 
1) The patient was not checked into the office. If you look up the patient chart and attempt to order a treatment without checking the patient into the office for a telephone encounter or entry of records, EncounterPRO interprets this as a historical treatment and will not send that item to the Document Manager screen. The prescription must be ordered from an open encounter in order to send to Document Manager and be eligible for SureScripts. </p>
 
 
 <p> 
2) The treatment mode for the specific medication was set to something other than eRX. The default treatment mode for prescription medications is set to e-RX. If a specific medication has the treatment mode set to something other than the default, it may not appear on the Document Manager screen. To change the treatment mode for a specific medication, follow the instructions in  <a href="../040818615510875.html">Screen: How to: Change the Default Treatment Mode for a Specific Treatment.</a> If there are multiple medications with this problem, contact EHRI Product Support for assistance in changing the treatment modes. </p>
 
 
 <p> 
<STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff>How do I add a pharmacy to the patient's Care Team?</FONT></STRONG> </p>
 
 
 <p> 
On the Document Management screen, if the patient has a NewRX ordered you can add pharmacies to the patient's Care Team. Select the Recipient bar and select Pharmacy. The Select Pharmacy screen appears. Search for the pharmacy that you want to add to the Care Team. Select the icon to the left of the pharmacy name and a menu of options appears. Select Add to Care Team. </p>
 
 
 <p> 
In version 5.1.12, you will be able to add pharmacies to the Care Team from the Patient Demographics screen. </p>
 
 
 <p> 
<STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff>How do I add a pharmacy to the practice's common short list?</FONT></STRONG> </p>
 
 
 <p> 
On the Document Management screen, if a patient has a NewRX ordered you can add pharmacies to the practice's common short list or the user's personal short list. Select the Recipient bar and select Pharmacy. The Select Pharmacy screen appears. Search for the pharmacy that you want to add to the short list. Select the icon to the left of the pharmacy name and a menu of options appears. Select Add to Common Short List or Add to Personal Short List. </p>
