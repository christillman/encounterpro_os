<FONT size=4>Purpose</FONT> <br /> 
After a patient has been diagnosed and treatments have seen ordered for that assessments, most of these items will remain open until they are manually closed by a provider or a staff member. <br /> 
 <br /> 
For example, a patient was diagnosed with sinusitis during last week's visit and a prescription was written for Claritin with multiple refills. When the same patient returns for a follow-up or for another office visit in few weeks, the sinusitis assessment and the prescription are still displayed on the Patient Chart because they are still open. <br /> 
 <br /> 
Treatments attached to an assessment will close when the associated assessment is closed. You can also close treatments while leaving the associated assessment open. For example, if you have a patient diagnosed with asthma, you can close certain treatments as you refine the treatment plan while leaving the assessment open. <br /> 
 </p>
 
 
 <p> 
<STRONG>Auto Closing Assessments</STRONG> <br /> 
Well and Sick assessments can be set to automatically close after the encounter or after a specified number of days, months, or years. This is based on the preferences of the practice and is done as part of configuration. See <U> <a href="040818215254057.html" target="_blank"> How to Modify an Assessment</a> </U>for instructions. </p>
