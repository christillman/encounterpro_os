<FONT size=4>Description</FONT> <br /> 
The encounterPRO Task list allows you to add tasks to your own MyTasks list or assign them to other users in the office. You can add two types of Tasks:  patient-related and non-patient-related. Patient-related Tasks are associated with a specific patient and are saved in the patient's chart. The advantage of creating a patient-related Task is that the user assigned the Task can open the patient's chart directly from the Task with a single touch. Non-patient related messages can be used to request that certain supplies need to be ordered. <br /> 
 </p>
 
  <p> 
In office and Out of Office Tasks <br /> 
When a patient is in the office, certain activities will automatically create service bars in the Office View. For example, when a provider orders a lab or test for a patient, the Collect Specimen task appears automatically as a service bar for the clinical staff. Additionally, when a user manually creates a Task for a patient who is in one of the Exam Rooms or a Telephone Room a service bar will be created. These tasks will <STRONG>not</STRONG> appear on the Task list, since they have a service bar in the Office View to notify the appropriate users to perform the task. <br /> 
 <br /> 
If the patient is <STRONG>not</STRONG> in the office, the task will appear on the Task list of the user or Role to which it was assigned. For example, if a lab report is scanned or entered after the patient has checked out, a Task is created for the encounter owner and will appear on his or her MyTasks list.  </p>

Assigning a Task <br /> 
Like messages, Tasks can be assigned to either a specific user or to a specific user role, such as Clinical Staff. When you assign a Task to a role, that task will appear in one of two ways: </p>
 
 <UL>
 
<LI class=bullets1>If the Task is for a patient who is in the office, a service bar appears in the Office View until a user takes it over and completes it 
 
<LI class=bullets1>If the Task is not for a specific patient or the patient is not in the office, a Task is created on the Role task list, viewable by every user assigned to that role. After one of those users performs the task to complete the ToDo item, it is removed from the ToDo list of the other users automatically.</LI></UL>

Organizing Your ToDo Items. </p>
 
 
 <p> 
EncounterPRO is delivered with two folders to organize your Tasks: Pending (unread) and Completed. When you open a Task and mark it as finished, it moves automatically to the Completed folder.  <br /> 
 <br /> 
<img src="images/content_note.gif" width="18" border="0"><FONT color=#009900><I>NOTE:&nbsp;Both messages and Tasks are considered legal documents and are never deleted. Patient-related&nbsp;Tasks are permanently saved as part of the patient's medical record. Also, keep in mind that messages and Tasks are <STRONG>not</STRONG> private. Certain users in your practice and all EHR Product&nbsp;Support personnel have access to all messages and Tasks. </p>
