<FONT size=4>Purpose</FONT> <br /> 
In version 4, EncounterPRO introduced the ability to export a single chart to a folder on the network or workstation hard drive. In version 5, you have the added ability to export a set of charts at one time. You select a set of charts by selecting patients from a list or by primary provider. <br /> 
 <br /> 
This function allows you to select multiple patient charts to export either to a set of files saved either on the network or workstation hard drive or a CD-ROM, or send it directly to the printer. <br /> 
 <br /> 
Also, if you want to print the charts en masse, then you will probably find it useful to get a relatively affordable printing manager. The software that EHR tested with this batch printing function can be found at <A href="http://www.traction-software.co.uk/batchprint/index.html">http://www.traction-software.co.uk/batchprint/index.html</A>. <br />

<LI class=numbers1>Select the Export Charts button. The Multi-Patient Chart Export screen appears.

 <br /> 
If you want to select a different directory, select the three-dot button to display the Browse for Folder dialog appears. Locate the desired directory, then select OK.  <br />

<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Send to Printer</STRONG>: the default is No. Select the No button to change it to Yes. Fields appear for you to select the destination printer and whether you want to print a separator page between patient files.
