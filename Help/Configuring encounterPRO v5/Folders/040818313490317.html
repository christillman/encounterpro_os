<FONT size=4>Purpose</FONT> <br /> 
Adding a workplan to a folder allows the practice to standardize processes in the office. When a document is added to a specific folder via scanning or file import, the workplan is kicked-off. Folder workplans can require a review step by the ordering provider, as in the case of a Lab Reports folder, or can automatically close the associated treatment as in the case of radiology reports. <br /> 
 </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> 
</FONT>Folders have a context assigned to them. This represents the piece of information within the chart with which the folder is connected: Patient, Encounter, Assessment, and Treatment. The workplans you attach to a folder need to 'match' the context of the folder. <br />
