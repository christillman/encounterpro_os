There are already lists for oustanding Labs and Tests, Prescription Medications, and Referrals. Some practices may want to add another list to track outstanding treatments for another treatment type. For example, if the practice sends patients out for x-ray services, an Outstanding X-rays list could be useful in keeping track of those treatments. </p>
 
  <p> 
There are three main stages to the procedure: </p>
 
 <OL> <LI class=numbers1>Add the observation type in the tables.  <LI class=numbers1>Assign the new observation type to the Treatment Types you want to include in the new Outstanding Treatment list.  <LI class=numbers1>Add a button for the new Outstanding Treatment list to the Utilities menu.</LI></OL>
