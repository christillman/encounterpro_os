<FONT size=4>Purpose</FONT> <br /> 
At the end of each encounter, the encounter owner can verify that the level chosen by the system is correct based on E&amp;M Coding laws and regulations.&nbsp; The verifying screen can be accessed from two places: on the patient's chart there is a small button labeled E M Coding Level with a number 1 through 5 on it; additionally on the Billing Review (Exit) screen there is a small button labeled Current Visit level with a number 1 through 5 on it. <br /> 
 <br /> 
Selecting either of these buttons takes the user to the Encounter Coding Levels screen.&nbsp; This screen indicates the level that was calculated and allows the user to get more details and make any necessary changes.&nbsp; This screen is shown below. <br /> 
&nbsp; <br /> 
The asterisks illustrate the level of coding determined by encounterPRO for each category: History, Examination, and Decision Making.&nbsp; EncounterPRO also lists the amount of time each person in the practice spent with the patient's chart.&nbsp; This is important documentation in case it is necessary to 'up-code' because of counseling time, a factor that encounterPRO does not include in the level algorithm. <br /> 
 <br /> 
The calculated visit level is highlighted in dark gray.&nbsp; The user can override this decision by manually highlighting a number at the User Selected Visit Level and then selecting finish.&nbsp; Choose the Details button below any of the categories to display details on the level achieved.  <br /> 
 <br /> 
The Coding Levels screen appears for the category, such as the History Coding Levels screen. E&amp;M Coding rules for this category can be accessed from the Review Coding Rules button. </p>
