<FONT size=2 face=sans-serif><FONT size=4>Description <br /> 
</FONT>This screen allows users to review the list of patients who have had an encounter during the day. After the patient has been seen by the healthcare provider and all in-office procedures (labs, tests, vaccines, etc.) have been completed, the patient's name will appear on the Checkout screen. (Workplans can also be configured to move the patient to a Pre-checkout room for approval before moving to Checkout.) Keep in mind that billing information will not be sent to the billing and scheduling system until the patient has been checked out. For this reason, it is important to clear out any patients in these pre-checkout areas, if applicable, at the end of each day. <br /> 
 <br /> 
The patients will remain in the Checkout room until the end of the day. You do not have to manually clear the room. When the calendar date changes to the next day, the Checkout room is automatically 'emptied'. Use the arrow buttons or the calendar to view the Checkout Room for a previous date. <br /> 
 <br /> 
 
 <p> 
<FONT color=#00cc00><img src="images/content_note.gif" width="18" border="0"><FONT color=#009900><I>NOTE: The default is to display both direct (in the office) and indirect (not in office) encounters. This means that telephone encounters (indirect) will be listed along with office visits. Change the Mode to Direct to view only those patients who were physically in the office.  <br /> 
 <br /> 
</FONT></FONT></I><FONT size=3>Icons on the Checkout Screen <br /> 
</FONT>Each encounter will have a billing status icon to the right of the patient bar. This icon indicates whether the billing for that specific encounter has been sent to the integrated billing system and if so, was the transfer successful. Select the Legend button to view a description of each billing status icon. <br />

 <br /> 
If there were documents (prescriptions, reports, patient materials, etc.) ordered during the encounter, a Document Management icon will appear to the right of the billing status icon. This icon will indicate whether all items have been routed (printer, fax, e-RX) or if there are items that need attention. </p>

<FONT size=4>How to Access This Screen <br /> 
</FONT>Access this screen by selecting Checkout from the Office View. <br /> 
 <br />

 <p> 
<FONT size=4>What Are Those Numbers on the Tabs?</FONT> </p>
 
 
 <p> 
<FONT size=4><FONT size=2>Tabs which have treatment rooms or can contain a list of patients will have a set of three numbers, such as 12/3/5. Each of those numbers indicates something about the patients and the waiting tasks (also called service bars) in that area. </FONT></FONT> </p>
 
 
 <p> 
<FONT size=4><FONT size=2><IMG border=1 alt="Office View tabs" align=left src="onsitehypermedia/090100120161718.gif">What the numbers mean:</FONT></FONT> </p>
 
 
<UL> 
<LI class=bullets1><FONT size=2><STRONG>First number:</STRONG> the number of patients in that area or group of rooms </FONT> 
<LI class=bullets1><FONT size=2><STRONG>Second number:</STRONG> the number of tasks assigned specifically to the current user </FONT> 
<LI class=bullets1><FONT size=2><STRONG>Third number:</STRONG> the number of tasks assigned to the roles that belong to the current user </FONT></LI></UL> 
 <p> 
<FONT size=2>So, if the current user is Nurse Betty, and the Office tab reads 3/0/3 there are 3 patients in the exam rooms, zero tasks assigned specifically to Nurse Betty, and 3 additional tasks that are assigned to the roles that are assigned to Nurse Betty (such as Clinical Staff and Lab Nurse).</FONT><FONT size=3> </FONT> <br />
