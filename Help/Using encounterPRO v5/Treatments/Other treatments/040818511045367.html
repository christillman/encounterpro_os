Patient instructions are considered treatments in encounterPRO. The provider can 'order' patient instructions from the treatment list of a particular assessment so that those instructions appear as part of the treatment plan for that assessment. If desired, the patient instructions can be ordered outside of an assessment and will appear on the Patient Chart for the encounter in which they were ordered. </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> 
</FONT>There are two types of instructions in encounterPRO: </p>
 
 <UL>
 
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Encounter instructions</STRONG> : which appear&nbsp;on the Patient Chart and assessment dashboard only for the encounter they were ordered. 
 
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Ongoing Instructions</STRONG> : which appear on the Patient Chart and assessment dashboard for all encounters going forward from the encounter in which they were ordered. Ongoing instructions will appear until the user either closes the instruction from the treatment dashboard screen or closes the assessment with which the instruction was originally associated.</LI></UL> <UL></UL>
