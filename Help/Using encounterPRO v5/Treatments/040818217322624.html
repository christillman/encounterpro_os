<FONT size=4>Purpose</FONT> <br /> 
Each assessment can be configured to display a list of commonly used treatments for easy ordering during encounters. With appropriate security privileges you can add and remove items from the treatment list for each assessment as needed. Each assessment's treatment list should represent the treatments commonly ordered by your practice.  While many assessment treatment lists are already configured, there may be several treatments that you want to add to the treatment list for each assessment. <br /> 
 </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> 
</FONT>There are two treatment lists for each assessment: Common and Personal. The Common list is used by all users in the practice and should be changed only after discussing with the other providers in the practice. The Personal list is viewable only by the user who created it. <br />

<OL> 
<LI class=numbers1>After you have selected an assessment, a treatment list appears.  
<LI class=numbers1>If a treatment you want to order is not already on the list, select the New Treatment button. A menu of treatment types appears.  
<LI class=numbers1>Select the treatment type for the treatment you want to add to the treatment list. The Select Treatment screen appears.  
<LI class=numbers1>Select the treatment(s) from the short list or use the search options to locate the desired treatments. You can select multiple treatments and each will appear in the Selected Items list.  
<LI class=numbers1>Select OK. The treatment list reappears with the new treatment(s) at the bottom of the list.  
<LI class=numbers1>The text of the new treatment appears in light (not bold) print, indicating that it has been ordered for this patient, but has not been permanently added to the treatment list for this assessment.  
<LI class=numbers1>To add the item to the treatment list, select the icon to the left of the treatment. The treatment item screen appears. <br /> 
&nbsp;<img src="images/content_note.gif" width="18" border="0"><FONT color=#009900><I>NOTE: If the treatment you want to add is a referral or follow-up, when you select the icon on the left, a screen similar to the above appears. There is no Update List option, however. If you simply select OK, the follow-up or referral will be added to the treatment list.  <br /> 
</I></FONT> 
<LI class=numbers1>Select the Yes button under Update List then select OK. The treatment list reappears. The description is now bold, indicating that it has been added to the treatment list for this assessment.  
<LI class=numbers1>Repeat steps 2&nbsp;-&nbsp;8 to add additional treatment items to the treatment list for this assessment.</LI></OL>
