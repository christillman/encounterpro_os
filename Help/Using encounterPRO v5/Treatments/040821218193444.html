Assessments and treatments can be canceled if they are ordered in error. If an assessment or treatment has been canceled inadvertently, it can be uncanceled.  </p>

<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> 
</FONT>When you cancel an assessment, all associated&nbsp;treatments are also canceled. When you uncancel&nbsp;an assessment that has canceled treatments associated with it, those treatments are not automatically uncanceled. If those treatments are valid, they need to be individually uncanceled.&nbsp; </p>
