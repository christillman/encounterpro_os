<FONT size=4>Purpose</FONT> <br /> 
The Daily Lab Results screen has been added to the Utilities list to help your practice track the labs and results. (The button will have the name of the lab facility you are integrated with, for example, Daily Labcorp.) If you are integrated with more than one external lab facility, you will have a button for each lab facility. <br /> 
 <br /> 
Your office can track and manage the labs by reviewing the Daily Lab Results screen to check for labs with no results and labs that have not been reviewed in a timely manner. <br /> 
 </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> 
</FONT>Labs that have been ordered must have the lab facility entered in the Sent to or Referred to field to appear on the list. See <U> <a href="040818410073710.html" target="_blank"> How to: Order Labs (Lab Integration)</a></U> for detailed instructions. <br />
