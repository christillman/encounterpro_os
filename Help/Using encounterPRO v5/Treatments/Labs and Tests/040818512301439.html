Lab and Test results can be reviewed from many different locations in encounterPRO. In the case of in house labs, the results will appear on the treatment dashboard, accessible from the patient's chart. When the labwork is done off site, then there are several options for locating and reviewing the results. <br /> 
 </p>
 
 <UL>
 
<LI class=bullets1>From the Treatment HX tab of the Patient Chart 
 
<LI class=bullets1>From the Lab History screen 
 
<LI class=bullets1>From the Daily Screen From the Outstanding Labs/Tests screen</LI></UL>  <p> 
 <br /> 
<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> 
</FONT>If your practice is integrated with a lab, then you will want to use the method, "To review results from the Daily screen." <br /> 
It is important to know whether the lab you are searching for is open or closed. Certain displays are restricted to only open treatments, while others will show both open and closed treatments. <br />
