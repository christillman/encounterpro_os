 <br /> 
<FONT size=4>Purpose <br /> 
</FONT>Follow-up visits can be ordered as part of the treatment plan for a specific assessment, as part of a general preventative visit schedule, etc. After the provider orders the follow-up and specifies the timeframe and purpose, the treatment workplan displays a service bar for the front desk staff. If no service bar is desired, that is a configuration option. <br /> 
 </p>
 
 
 <p> 
<FONT size=4>Before You Begin</FONT> </p>
 
 
 <p> 
If you want to order specific treatments as part of the follow-up treatment, you can do so. It is important that the clinical staff know that you will be ordering follow-ups with these associated treatments so that when the patient returns for that follow-up visit the proper workplan can be dispatched. Please review the solution Concept: Follow-ups with Associated Treatments before you order your follow-up. </p>
