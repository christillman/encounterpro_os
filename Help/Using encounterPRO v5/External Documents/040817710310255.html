<FONT size=4>Purpose <br /> 
</FONT>Many practices assign the scanning and posting tasks to the administrative personnel. The scanning and posting feature allows you to add any paper document to the patient's chart. This is a two-stage process: 1) Scan the document 2) Post the document to the appropriate location in the patient's chart. <br /> 
 <br /> 
If you are scanning old documents, such as lab reports and items that were not ordered through encounterPRO, you post them to folders within the patient's chart. Items that go with specific treatments and assessments ordered through encounterPRO should be posted directly to that open treatment or assessment. See  <a href="040817911002884.html" target="_blank"> How to: Post Documents to a Treatment</a> for those instructions. </p>
 
  <p> 
If your practice has more than one location which performs scanning, you can create a To Be Posted list for each location. This makes it easier to locate the scanned items at each location. See  <a href="040821218114422.html" target="_blank"> How to: Add a To-Be-Posted List</a>. </p>

The scanner must be configured for this station under the External Sources screen. You can, however, post previously scanned documents from a workstation that is not attached to the scanner. <br />

</FONT>Follow the steps below: <br /> 
<EM><FONT color=#6600ff>To Scan Documents into encounterPRO:</FONT></EM> </p>
 
 <OL> <LI class=numbers1>From the Office view, select the Utilities tab. The Utilities list appears. The options available depend on your security access rights.  <LI class=numbers1>Select Scan/Post Images. The Import and Post Attachments screen appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the Import button. The Import Attachments screen appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the Attachment Source for your scanner. If there is an option for 'TWAIN Compatible Scanner', choose that option. A scanning dialog box appears. This box will vary based on the scanner installed.  <LI class=numbers1>Set the scanning settings for the document you are scanning. Generally, you will be scanning Black and White documents that are Letter Sized. Select the 150 dpi setting. Select the Scan button to begin scanning. (Scanning at a higher dpi setting will create attachments that require much more storage space.)  <LI class=numbers1>The Images to Post screen reappears with the new item added to the top of the list.  <LI class=numbers1>Repeat steps 3 through 6 to scan each item. When finished scanning, select OK. The Utilities list reappears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select Exit to return to the Office view.</LI></OL>  <p> 
<EM><FONT color=#6600ff>To Post to a Folder in a Patient's Chart:</FONT></EM> </p>
 
 <OL> <LI class=numbers1>From the Office view, select the Utilities tab. The Utilities list appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select Scan/Post Images. The Import and Post Attachments screen appears. The list on the left shows all the scanned items that have not yet been posted to a patient's chart.  <LI class=numbers1>Select an item from the list on the left. A preview of the item appears in the gray box on the right.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the Post button. The Patient Search screen appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Enter the search criteria to locate the patient into whose chart you want to post this document. Select the patient name bar. A screen appears with a list of folders on the right.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the folder appropriate for the document you are posting.  <LI class=numbers1>Select whether or not you want to remove the document from the previous folder (the unposted list). Do not remove the item from the previous folder if you want to post this same item to another folder.  <LI class=numbers1>Select OK. The document is now located in the folder you chose. The patient name appears on the Import and Post screen at the bottom.  <LI class=numbers1>To post additional documents from the unposted list to this same patient, select the item, then select the name bar. Repeat steps 6 through 9. To post documents to a different patient's chart, repeat steps 3 through 9.  <LI class=numbers1>When done posting, select OK. The Utilities list reappears. Select Exit to return to the Office view.</LI></OL> <P class=numbers1><FONT size=4>Want to Learn More?</FONT> </p>
