<FONT size=4>Purpose</FONT> <br /> 
Standard exams can be a great time saver when entering physicals, ROS, or lab results. They allow one-touch population of results on a drill-down screen. After selecting the standard exam button to populate the results, the provider or nurse can change any of those results which do not apply to the current patient as needed. Your system was delivered with several standard exams, and you may have created others. From time to time, you may need to modify the results for those exams. <br /> 
 </p>
 
 
 <p> 
<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> 
</FONT>You must have the specific permissions to be able to modify common standard exams which can be used by the entire office. All clinical users have the ability to create and modify their own personal standard exams that are visible only to them. <br /> 
 <br /> 
<img src="images/content_tip.gif" width="18" border="0"><I><FONT color=#0000ff>TIPS:  <br /> 
Changing the Common Standard Exams should only be done with the agreement of all users who will be using that exam.  <br /> 
 <br /> 
If you decide to create your own Personal Standard Exams, choose a name that is NOT the same as the Common Standard Exam to reduce confusion. Many users prefix the exam name with their initials to clearly identify Personal Standard Exams. <br />
