 <p> 
Scribing is a technique for documenting encounters which allows another user, the scribe, to&nbsp;accompany the provider during patient examinations transcribe a patient's history and serve as the provider's documenter. When a scribing user is logged in the blue information line at the top of the screen will indicate that the logged on user is the selected user, not the scribe. All information documented during the current session will be noted as being documented by the scribe <STRONG>under the direction of the selected user</STRONG>. There are several steps that need to be performed in order to act as a scribe during an encounter. </p>
 
 
 <p> 
<FONT size=4>Enable Scribing for the Practice</FONT> </p>
 
 
 <p> 
EncounterPRO allows the practice to enable scribing through a General Preference. This preference can be set at all levels: </p>
 
 
<UL> 
<LI class=bullets1>Global  
<LI class=bullets1>Office  
<LI class=bullets1>Computer  
<LI class=bullets1>Specialty  
<LI class=bullets1>User</LI></UL> 
 <p> 
<FONT size=4>Set User Permission to Scribe for Other Users</FONT> </p>
 
 
 <p> 
The permissions for any user who will be scribing for others need to be set on the User Configuration screen. </p>
 
 
 <p> 
<FONT size=4>Log In as the Scribe</FONT> </p>
 
 
 <p> 
When&nbsp; user who has permissions to scribe for others logs in to encounterPRO, the system will prompt the user to select which provider for whom he or she will be scribing. </p>
 
 
 <p> 
<FONT face=Arial><SPAN style="COLOR: red; FONT-STYLE: italic">IMPORTANT:&nbsp; Each user who logs in to scribe for another user must agree to abide by the following: <br /> 
<FONT color=#ff0000>'By logging into the EncounterPRO® Electronic Health Record as a scribe for a licensed provider, I hereby affirm that the provider I designate has specifically asked me to do so.&nbsp; I further affirm that when I am logged into the EncounterPRO EHR as a scribe, I am only recording observations and orders made and communicated to me by such provider.&nbsp; I am not recording my own observations, orders or other information.'</FONT></SPAN> <br />
