EncounterPRO can assist you in monitoring patients who have recurring acute problems, such as sinusitis or otitis media. You can see which treatments have been used for this patient in the past to help you determine today's treatment plan. If needed, you can generate a report of all the occurrences of a particular assessment to send with a referral.  </p>
 
  <p> 
Recurring problems are noted on the Patient Chart by a number in parentheses such as (2X), (3X), etc. This notation appears next to the assessment description and denotes the number of times that the patient has been diagnosed with that problem. <br />
