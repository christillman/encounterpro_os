On rare occasions a duplicate chart will be created in the database. When this happens, you can perform a merge patient function to combine the two charts into one. This operation removes all information from one chart and moves it into the designated destination chart. Be sure you know which chart you want to keep and which can be discarded before beginning this process. <br /> 
 </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> 
</FONT>Merging charts is a restricted function. The instructions assume that a Merge Patients button has been added to the Utilities list. If you have the appropriate permissions, but do not see the button you can add it. See <A href='../../Configuring encounterPRO v5/Menus/040819217242468.html'>How to: Customize Menus</A> for details. <br /> 
 <br /> 
<EM><FONT color=#ff0000>CAUTION: Use extreme caution! This operation cannot be undone (even by EHR Product Support). If you merge the incorrect files, you will need to re-create both original files. The system will prompt you several times to make sure that you understand the consequences of this action. <br />
