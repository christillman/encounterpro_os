Prior to EncounterPRO 35, the portrait box would not display the portrait if the attachment title was other than 'Portrait'.  Prior to EncounterPRO 33, the title of an imported portrait was hard coded as 'Portrait' so the portraits always displayed. The EncounterPRO Client version 33 introduced more flexibility in the attachment file importing screens so that now the users may change the attachment title. In EncounterPRO Client version 35, the portrait box is smartened to display the portrait no matter what it's title is. That means that with EncounterPRO Client version 33 and 34, if the user imports a portrait and gives it a title other than 'Portrait', it will not display in the portrait box.

Hotfix 88 makes sure that any attachment imported into the portrait folder is automatically shown in the portrait box on the SOAP screen and on the demographics screen. It re-connects portraits which were imported into the 'Portraits' folder but not given title 'Portrait'.

1) Hotfix 88 adds logic to a trigger to make sure that any attachment imported into the portrait folder is automatically shown in the portrait box on the SOAP screen and on the demographics screen. <br /> 
2) It will also re-connect any portraits which were imported into the 'Portraits' folder already but were not given the title 'Portrait'. <br /> 
3) After running Hotfix 88, the users no longer need to name the attachment 'Portrait', even if they're using client version 33 or 34. </p>
