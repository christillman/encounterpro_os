Cause:

 <p> 
The reason is once in a while the files dropped into checkin and demogfx folder are not deleted and so encounterpro PM interface is constantly reading and sending acknowledgements which causes the ports to shut down. </p>

This article explains how to resolve interface issues in Island Coast Peds for Encounterpro vs Mysis interface. Connect to ICP and RDP to ICSERV1. Stop these services: encounterproservice, epro billingacks, eprosocketcheckin, eprosocketdemogfx, eprosocketmessbilling. Go to D:\jmj\pmshare, and D:\Program Files\SocketMessenger\MessageQueue&nbsp;and ensure all folders and subfolders are empty. Restart all the services. </p>

This article explains how to resolve the interface issues in Island Coast Peds for Encounterpro vs Mysis interface. </p>
 
  <p> 
Workaround <br /> 
Connect to ICP and RDP to ICSERV1 (this is where services and PM folders folders are installed) and do the following.  </p>
 
  <p> 
1) Stop the following services: <br /> 
&nbsp; a) encounterproservice  <br /> 
&nbsp; b) epro billingacks&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br /> 
&nbsp; c) eprosocketcheckin  <br /> 
&nbsp; d) eprosocketdemogfx  <br /> 
&nbsp; e) eprosocketmessbilling  <br /> 
2) Go to D:\jmj\pmshare and make sure all the folders and subfolders underneath are empty. If you notice files stuck in any of the folders, delete them.  <br /> 
3) Go to D:\Program Files\SocketMessenger\MessageQueue and make sure all the folders and subfolders under this directory are empty. If you see any files in any of the folders, delete them.  <br /> 
4) Restart all the services in step 1. </p>

There is no rhyme or reason on why one or two files are orphaned by AHC in the checkin and demogfx folders which causes our system to process and produce loads of acks to halt the interface system. This is not noticed or reported anywhere and no resolution as this is AHC s/w bug. The good news is EHR-Development is migrating the AHC to XML.NET (Mid 2008 for BETA) and so these kinds of problems will no longer be an issue. There is a scheduled job that constantly monitor the checkin and demogfx folder to remove any orphaned files every mid night to reduce these issues. </p>
