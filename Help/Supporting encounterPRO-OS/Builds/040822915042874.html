Version 4: <br /> 
1) Run the script below (some fields will have to be changed). <br /> 
2) <A href="https://www.jmjtech.com/KB/support_scripts/version4/misc/close_treatments.sql">Close Treatments in Version 4.0 Script</A>. (https://www.jmjtech.com/KB/support_scripts/version4/misc/close_treatments.sql) </p>
 
  <p> 
Version 2: <br /> 
There is a bug in version 2 that leaves the 'test' and 'referral tests' still open even if the lab results are posted as an attachment. (thru scan post). This is causing lot of problems to verison 2 customers and leaves treatments open forever. So to forcefully close those open 'REFERRAL' and 'TEST' treatments please run the following queries. </p>
 
  <p> 
1) Close Open referrals up until a given date (if they say 'July 1,2004 then it'll close everything that's ordered until July 1,2004) <br /> 
  a) In case if you need to see how referral records are open for the given date then run the following query: <br /> 
 select * from p_treatment_item where treatment_type like 'referr%' and (treatment_status is null or treatment_status='COLLECTED') and created &lt; 'mm/dd/yyyy' <br /> 
  b) To close all the referral and it's child treatments for a given date run the following query: <br /> 
update p_treatment_item set treatment_status='CLOSED' where treatment_type like 'referr%' and (treatment_status is null or treatment_status='COLLECTED') and created &lt; 'mm/dd/yyyy'. <br /> 
2) Close Open Tests up until a given date (if they say 'July 1,2004 then it'll close everything that's ordered until July 1,2004) <br /> 
  a) In case if you need to see how referral records are open for the given date then run the following query: <br /> 
select * from p_treatment_item where treatment_type like 'TEST' and (treatment_status is null or treatment_status='COLLECTED') and created &lt; 'mm/dd/yyyy' <br />
