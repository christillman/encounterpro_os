This document describes the algorithm used to accumulate billing information during an encounter.&nbsp; The algorithm consists of a set of rules.&nbsp; Each rule represents an event which may occur during the course of an encounter.&nbsp; The items underneath each numbered rule represent the cases and/or logic of how the billing records are affected. </p>

<FONT face=sans-serif size=2><FONT size=4>Definitions</FONT> <br /> 
There are two kinds of billing records.&nbsp; The <STRONG><EM>assessment-billing records</EM></STRONG> determine the ICD codes associated with the encounter. The assessment-billing records usually represents an assessment or diagnosis made or addressed during the encounter, but may not have an associated diagnosis, as in the case of immunizations.&nbsp; Encounters must have at least one assessment-billing record in order to bill.</FONT> </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT face=sans-serif size=2>The <STRONG><EM>charge record</EM></STRONG> represents an actual billable item/event/service that occurred during the encounter.&nbsp; The charge records will ultimately determine the CPT codes that will be associated with the encounter.</FONT> </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT face=sans-serif size=2>EncounterPRO also keeps track of the relationships between the assessment-billing records and the charge records.&nbsp; The billing algorithm below explains how these associations are created.</FONT> </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Each assessment-billing record and each charge record has a 'bill_flag' property.&nbsp; The bill_flag property in these records will always be set to either 'Y' (Yes&nbsp;- Do Bill) or 'N' (No&nbsp;- Do Not Bill).&nbsp; The billing algorithm explains where the default values come from.&nbsp; The user is able to manually change the bill_flag for any record so the default value may not be the final value when the billing is generated and exported to a billing system.</FONT> </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Some of the billing rules depend on whether the encounter is classified as a Sick Encounter or a Well Encounter.&nbsp; A <EM><STRONG>Well Encounter</STRONG></EM> is defined as an encounter in which an assessment is created where the bill_flag is 'Y' and the assessment_type is 'Well'.&nbsp; A <EM><STRONG>Sick Encounter</STRONG></EM> is defined as any encounter that A) has an associated assessment where the bill_flag is 'Y' and the assessment_type is not 'Well' or 'Vaccine', or B) does not have an assessment created where the bill_flag is 'Y' and the assessment_type is 'Well'.&nbsp; An encounter may be considered both a Well Encounter and a Sick Encounter at the same time.</FONT> </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT face=sans-serif size=2>The <EM><STRONG>Primary Treatment Charge</STRONG></EM> is the charge associated with a treatment where the procedure_id of the charge matches p_Treatment_Item.procedure_id.</FONT> </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT face=sans-serif size=2>The <EM><STRONG>Primary Payer Authority</STRONG></EM> for a patient is the first payer authority associated with the patient (i.e. the record from p_Patient_Authority where authority_type = 'PAYOR' and authority_sequence = 1).</FONT> </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT face=sans-serif size=2>The <EM><STRONG>well_encounter_flag</STRONG></EM> is a flag in the c_Assessment_Type table and the c_Procedure table.&nbsp; This flag indicates whether or not the assessment type or the procedure charge (respectively) is generally associated with a well visit.&nbsp; It does not restrict any charge from being associated with any assessment, but it affects the default assignment of the one to the other for billing purposes.&nbsp; The possible values for the flag are: <br /> 
 </p>
 
 <UL>
 
<LI class=bullets1>'Y' : This assessment or charge is generally associated with well encounters 
 
<LI class=bullets1>'N' : This assessment or charge is generally not associated with well encounters 
 
<LI class=bullets1>'A' : This assessment or charge may be associated with any encounter</LI></UL>  <p> 
The column is nullable for backward compatibility and a null value is treated as identical with 'A'. <br />
