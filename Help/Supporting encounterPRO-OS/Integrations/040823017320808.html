Advise the customer that he or she will need to unmap the results by going to the lab dashboard screen (for the lab to which the results were posted). See Umapping Lab Results. </p>
 
  <p> 
Then he or she will need to delete the original lab treatment, reorder it for the same encounter date, and advise EHR as to which results we need to resend. Once the results are resent they will be waiting in scan/post to be manually posted. </p>
