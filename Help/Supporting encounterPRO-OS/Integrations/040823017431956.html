Cause:
</td>
<td class="sectionContent">
Once results have been manually posted to a certain lab, they will automatically post to that lab thereafter. However, there are some cases in which they will not automatically post even if the results have already been mapped. Epro matches the results based on the date that the test was ordered (the results and the test must have the same date!), but occasionally the provider will order the same test on the same day.  In this case, the results will not auto-post. A provider who is behind on charting may send the requisition form to the lab company before she actually orders the lab in Epro. If the results return before the lab is ordered, they will not automatically post because of the mis-matched dates.
