<FONT face=sans-serif size=2>  <p> 
'More than one patient identifier' message when posting results. <br /> 
1) When a user selects results from scan/post to be posted, and clicks 'Post', she gets a message saying that Epro has found more than one patient identifier and to only click yes if you are absolutely sure that this is the patient you want. <br /> 
2) ALWAYS click 'No'. <br /> 
3) This happens because the lab company has sent over a patient id that is different from the Epro billing id. <br /> 
4) Epro doesn't recognize this id, and if you click yes, a new patient chart will be created. <br /> 
5) The lab company must either send over the Epro billing id, or no patient id at all. <br /> 
6) In the absence of an id, Epro will select the patient by name, DOB, and SS#. </p>
 
  <p> 
'Error processing document' message when posting results. <br /> 
1) Many times when this happens the file is corrupted.  <br /> 
2) Delete the results, resend them and try to post them again or check to see that they were auto-posted to the chart. </p>
 
  <p> 
User is kicked out of Epro while trying to post a document. <br /> 
This is usually either a problem caused by the Citrix connection, in which case they may need an upgrade, or it is a matter of running all Office Updates (on server and fat clients). </p>
 
  <p> 
User receives an error message after clicking 'Post' and/or is unable to post anything. <br /> 
1) This is different than the issue discussed above. This occurs when user clicks 'post' in 'Scan/Post', gets an EPRO error message and is then unable to post any lab for any patient. <br /> 
2) With Mod Level 128 and above, if they are having problems in posting the lab results (it throws error in posting XML document) try installing Hotfix 257 which fixes the following error. </p>
