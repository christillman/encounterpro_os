1) When the lab is downloaded it is replacing the pt's office ID# with pt's SSN. <br /> 
- Epro Lab results engine never updates the patient record and so this is not possible. </p>
 
  <p> 
2) Some of the labs that were listed as being sent to LabCorp aren't downloading and I'm just getting the results off my LabCorp printer. <br /> 
- Need specific examples to troubleshoot. </p>
 
  <p> 
3) One of the first patients I did has all his lab results listed under ONE lab test instead of dividing them up under the correct lab.  <br /> 
- A result message contains results for one or more labs ordered. But epro engine attempts to split them as individual results and automatically (or manually) selects the right treatment in order to post the results. There is no way two different lab order results posted to single lab treatment unless the user accidently selects the same treatment for posting different lab results. </p>
 
  <p> 
4) One of the patients name is misspelled by LabCorp so unsure if it will post. <br /> 
- Right now the epro lab results engine looks up the patient by our internal billing id or lab vendor id. So the misspelled names should not be an issue. </p>
 
  <p> 
5) I posted a results to treatment but no message was sent to the doctor to make him aware that the results were back even though the results were in the patient's chart. <br /> 
- Once a result is posted it automatically generates a 'TODO' item and puts them in doctors todo list for review. If not then notify our 'Config' team to look into this. </p>
 
  <p> 
6) What do I do if I accidently delete a results instead of posting it?  <br /> 
- Request JMJ support for those deleted patients (with date the result was received) to resend them again. </p>
