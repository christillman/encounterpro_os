Make sure the following three patients are entered as new patients in the client's db: <br /> 
1) Lab JMJ Test, JMJ Auto <br /> 
2) Lab JMJ Test, JMJ Manual <br /> 
3) Lab JMJ Test, JMJ Multiple           <br /> 
<img src="images/content_note.gif" width="18" border="0"><FONT color=#009900><I>NOTE: If they do not appear in db then run utility script 'Enable Lab Interface' and restart services. If there is no such utility script, speak with Sumathi Asok.</I></FONT> <br /> 
  <br /> 
1) Log in to 'CMA' at <A href='http://www.jmjtech.com/mgmt'>www.jmjtech.com/mgmt</A>, select 'Customer Management' from the links on the left, then scroll down to locate the practice and select the ID. <br /> 
2) Next, in 'Epro', check in all three lab test patients as a past date encounter. Lab Test, JMJ Manual needs to be checked in for 1/6/2006. Lab Test, JMJ Auto and Lab Test, JMJ Multiple past encounter date needs to be 3/3/2006.   <br /> 
3) Order a Urine Culture (send out) for Lab Test, JMJ Manual. Make sure lab reads  before clicking 'Finish'.  <br /> 
4) Now select the 'Lab Company' as the consultant on the 'Collect/Refer' screen by clicking the button located next to either 'Patient Referred To:' or 'Specimen Sent To:' depending on if the practice refers the patient or collects the specimen in-house. If practice collects in-house, then click on the button to highlight it before clicking 'Finish' to send lab order.  <br /> 
5) In 'CMA', click 'Send Manualtest JMJ Lab Results'. *You will only click 'Send Autotest JMJ LabResults' when sending results for Lab Test, JMJ Auto.  <br /> 
6) Scroll down to find the 'Messages' table. You should see the message job dispatched.  <br /> 
7) When the 'Status' is 'Completed', (Refresh by clicking the 'Today' button) the results should be in 'Epro'. (If the message tkaes longer than 2 minutes to complete, check the o_service_schedule table and change the schedule interval time to 2 minutes.)  <br /> 
8) In 'Epro', go to 'Daily Lab Results' in 'Utilities'. Go to 1/6/2006. You should see the lab ordered. The 'Results' column will be blank because the mapping isn't done yet. <br /> 
9) Go to 'Scan/Post' in 'Utilities' and select the .xml file for Lab Test, JMJ Manual and click 'Post'. In the next screen select the Urine Culture lab dated 1/6/2006 located to the left under 'Existing Treatments' section then click 'Post to Treatment'.  <br /> 
10) Return to Daily Lab Results, 1/6/2006. You should see today's date and 'Final' in the 'Results' column.  <br /> 
11) Repeat steps 3 thru 7 for Lab Test, JMJ Auto. *For step 5 click 'Send Autotest JMJ LabResults' only. When the message is complete, the 'Daily Lab Results' screen for 3/3/2006 should show the Results received today. Because the mapping for Urine Culture was already done in step 9, you do not have to do it again for this lab.  <br /> 
12) Click on the 'Review' button for both labs. You can review from 'Daily Lab Results', 'To Do List', or 'Outstanding Treatment/Tests'. <br /> 
13) Now order a Urine Culture for 3/3/2006 for Lab Test, JMJ Multiple using steps 3 and 4 only.     <br /> 
14) Go to 'Scan/Post' in 'Utilities'. Select the xml file for Lab Test, JMJ Multiple. Since the CBC was not pre-ordered, it will not appear in the 'Existing Treatments' list on the left. <br /> 
15) Create a new treatment (menu located on the right)  by selecting  'Treatment type' and clicking 'Lab'. <br /> 
16) Select lab named 'CBC w/DIFF w/PLT', confirm the begin date of 3/3/2006 then select 'New Treatment'. *The CBC will NOT appear on Daily Lab Results nor will it send a TODO item but the results have posted to the chart.  <br /> 
17) In 'Epro', go to 'Daily Lab Results' for 3/3/2006. The Urine Culture for Multiple should have auto-posted. The results for the CBC have not. </p>
