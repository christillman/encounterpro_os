Sometimes, practices want a treatment folder to contain more than just one treatment type. For instance, a practice has a 'Lab result' folder that they want to use for both labs and detailed procedures. From 'Scan/post' under 'Utilities', they post a scanned item to a patient and choose the 'Lab Result' folder, after clicking 'OK' on the choose folder screen, they cannot pick the 'Detailed Procedure' treatment type.

1) First, make sure that the folder is attached to (all of) the desired treatment types. <br /> 
2) Look at c_folder_selection and filter for the desired treatment folder. <br /> 
3) Make sure that there is a record with the context_object_type for each treatment type that you want to be in the folder. <br /> 
4) Set any records you create to have the auto_select_flag at N and make sure the sort sequence you pick is unique. <br /> 
5) Then, go to c_folder and make sure there is nothing in the context_object_type field for that folder. </p>
