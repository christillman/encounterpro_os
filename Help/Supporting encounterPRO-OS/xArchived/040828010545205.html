This article explains how to verify/configure the PHINMS interface which is used for various (Arkansas) vaccine registry interfaces. </p>
 
  <p> 
PHINMS (Public Health Information Network Messaging System) 2.1 is what is installed and configured to use for Arkansas Vaccine Registry Interface. The installation and configuration are in EPIE under c:\PHINMS2.1. There is a 'PHINMS' database that is installed techserv. There is a route file (*.XML) that needs to be installed and configured in order to change the message routing to destination. Following are the hints on various things to know about PHINMS configuration. </p>
 
  <p> 
1) The name of the route PHINMS sender is set to use is in (m_addressee_property (2.0)/m_interface_service_transport_property(EPIE3.0)) as property='routeinfo <br /> 
2) If there is a latest CPA file (route info) from the interface partner then drop this file into <A href="file://\\epie\c\phinms2.1\client\config\cpa">\\epie\c\phinms2.1\client\config\cpa</A>. Then go to routemap.xml and add an entry for the new CPA (name, cpa) and then enter the &lt;name&gt; as the value for the property 'routeinfo' as explained in step 1. <br /> 
3) The name of the PHINMS DB and other configuration are defined in sender.xml. <br /> 
4) When the PHINMS sender sends the message, it is queued up in table 'transportq_out' in PHINMS DB on techserv with status of 'queued' (pending for phinms to transmit). <br /> 
5) It is not currently supporting to install the PHINMS2.1 as windows service and so to make this running all the time ask Sumathi/Mat/ Chris/Mark to connect to EPIE in Console (mstsc /console to RDP) and start the 'startclient.bat' file to run this service which will transmit the messages to destination. <br /> 
6) Whenever a new CPA is sent, we have to make sure the new SSL Certificate is also installed. </p>
