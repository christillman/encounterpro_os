<FONT size=4>Purpose</FONT> <br /> 
Patient materials can be any document, handout, diagram which has been imported or scanned into EncounterPRO. Providers typically "order" patient materials as part of the treatment plan for a particular assessment, such as during a well child visit. If desired, patient materials can be ordered without being associated with a specific assessment. <br /> 
 </p>
 
 
 <p> 
<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> </FONT>Before the provider can order patient materials as part of a treatment plan, the document must be imported or scanned into EncounterPRO. See <A href="../../../Configuring EncounterPRO-OS/Patient materials/040817713534272.html">How to: Add Patient Education Materials</A> for detailed instructions. <br />

The treatment list for the selected assessment appears.  <br /> 
 
<LI class=numbers1>If the patient material you want to order appears on the treatment list, select it. You can select as many treatments from the list as needed.  
<LI class=numbers1>If the patient material you want to order does not appear on the treatment list, select the New Treatment button on the right of the list screen. The Select Patient Education Materials screen appears.  
<LI class=numbers1>Select the desired patient material from the short list or use the search options to locate the desired items.

<LI class=numbers1>If you want to save a patient material to the treatment list for future use, select the small icon to the left of the description.  
<LI class=numbers1>Select the Yes button below Update List, then OK. The treatment list may automatically sort the list to place the new treatment at the top of the list.
