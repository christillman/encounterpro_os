<FONT size=4>Purpose</FONT> <br /> 
Labs and tests that are processed off site must be tracked so that the results can be reviewed, relayed to the patient, and providers can be alerted when abnormal results are returned. <br /> 
Your practice needs to have a process in place that determines the following: </p>
 
 
<UL> 
<LI class=bullets1>Who is responsible for tracking labs and tests that are sent out?  
<LI class=bullets1>How will providers be notified of lab results?  
<LI class=bullets1>How will patients be notified of lab results?  
<LI class=bullets1>Who is responsible for closing the treatment?</LI></UL> 
 <p> 
The answers to these questions will vary from practice to practice and sometimes provider to provider. It is important that all the personnel understand which tasks they are expected to perform so that nothing "falls through the cracks." <br /> 
 </p>

<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> </FONT>If your practice has lab integration, see&nbsp; <a href="../../Histories/040818915330863.html">Screen: How to: Track and Manage Lab Results - Lab Integration</a>.&nbsp; This solution discusses tracking off site lab results in a non-integrated environment. <br />
