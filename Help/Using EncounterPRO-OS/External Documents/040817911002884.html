Lab reports and other documents that pertain to a specific treatment need to be posted (attached) to that treatment. You can do this by posting directly into the patient's chart or by using the outstanding treatment lists on the Utilities list. If you have multiple treatment reports for multiple patients, many practices prefer to post using the outstanding treatments list. See  <a href="040817911370499.html"> How to: Scan and Post Directly to a Patient's Chart</a> if you want to post multiple items for a single patient. <br /> 
 </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> </FONT>You must set up your workstation with the scanner as an External Source to be able to scan and post. See  <a href="040817815513703.html"> How to: Configure a Workstation to Scan</a> for instructions.  <br />

 <OL> <LI class=numbers1>From the Utilities list, select the appropriate Outstanding Labs/Tests button. A list of outstanding labs, tests, or other treatments appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the item to which you will post the attachment. You may have to filter or search by patient name.

A list of External Sources appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select EncounterPRO Attachment as the External Source. The Attachments screen appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the To Be Posted tab.

A thumbnail version (preview) appears in the white box on the right. Confirm that this is the item you want to attach to the current treatment.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the Select button. The system will ask if you want to remove the item from the to-be-posted list. In most cases, the answer will be Yes. If this is an item you want to post to more than one treatment or more than one patient, select No to leave it in the To Be Posted list.  <LI class=numbers1>You may be prompted to select a folder for this attachment. Select a folder from the list on the right, then OK.  <LI class=numbers1>Depending on the folder selected, an Attachment Workplan screen may appear. (Folders can have workplans attached that are automatically launched when an item is saved to that folder.) If you want to launch the workplan (very important if this is a lab integration practice), select Finished. If you do not want to launch the workplan, select No Workplan This Time. A bar appears with the name of the attachment (defaulted from the treatment) and the date attached.  <LI class=numbers1>Select Finished save the attachment and return to the Outstanding Treatments list..</LI></OL>  <p>
