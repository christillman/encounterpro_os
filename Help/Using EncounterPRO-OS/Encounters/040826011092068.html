 <P class=bullets1>A follow-up encounter will generally follow the same workplan as a sick encounter (Office Visit). Some follow-ups will have treatments pre-ordered that will be dispatched when the patient is checked in. EncounterPRO will present a list of pending follow-up orders when the patient is checked in and a user will select the appropriate follow-up from the list and dispatch the associated workplans. Which user dispatches the follow-up workplan is determined by your check-in process. If you are using manual check-in, the Front Desk Administrator will select the follow-up related to the new encounter. If you are using an integrated check-in process, the Clinical Staff will select the follow-up related to the new encounter. </p>

<OL> 
<LI class=numbers1><EM>If the patient is manually checked in</EM> for a New Encounter, the system will display a list of pending follow-ups for the patient and prompt the user to indicate which follow-up this encounter is related to. Do one of the following: <br /> 
 
<UL> 
<LI class=bullets1>Select the related follow-up from the list then select OK.  
<LI class=bullets1>If the new encounter is <STRONG>not</STRONG> related to any of the pending follow-ups, select 'This encounter is not related to a followup order.'</LI></UL> <br /> 
<EM>If the patient is checked in via integration with a PMS</EM>, the system will create a service bar for the Clinical Staff to select the follow-up and dispatch the workplan, or if the new encounter is not related to one of the follow-ups listed, cancel the workplan.  
<LI class=numbers1>If any treatments were ordered as part of the follow-up selected in step 1, service bars will appear for those treatments. (For example, a lab collection or in-office medication.)  
<LI class=numbers1>The clinical staff workflow will proceed according to the encounter type of the encounter.  
<LI class=numbers1>When it is time to order an assessment, if this encounter is related to an open assessment, select that assessment from the Patient Chart. At this point, the provider can do any combination&nbsp;of the following: <br /> 
 
<UL> 
<LI class=bullets1>Add a progress note  
<LI class=bullets1>Order a new treatment  
<LI class=bullets1>Close a treatment  
<LI class=bullets1>Close the assessment (if the assessment is closed, the provider can choose whether or not to bill for the assessment in the current encounter)</LI></UL> 
<LI class=numbers1>When the encounter is complete, confirm that any billable treatments ordered as part of the follow-up appear on the billing screen and are associated with the appropriate assessments.</LI></OL>
