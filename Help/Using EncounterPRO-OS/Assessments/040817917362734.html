<FONT size=4>Purpose</FONT> <br /> 
It is important for both the clarity of the clinical data and for the billing that treatments are associated with the appropriate assessment(s) in the Patient Chart. This is done easily by ordering the treatments from the treatment list of the specific assessment. If a treatment is ordered from outside the assessment context, you can later associate the treatment later. See <U><A href='../Billing/Encounter billing/040818218543729.html'>How to: Associate Treatments With a Specific Assessment</A></U>&#160; for instructions. <br /> 
 </p>
 
  <p> 
Before You Begin <br /> 
If you order an assessment and then later determine, from lab results or other information, that a different assessment is more appropriate you can re-diagnose, choosing the other assessment and keeping the original treatment plan intact. See <A href='040818512165078.html'>How to: Rediagnose an Assessment </A>for details. <br />

<OL> 
<LI class=numbers1>When you are ready to order assessments and treatments, access the Patient Chart.  
<LI class=numbers1>If you want to update an existing assessment, select the blue date of the assessment to access the dashboard screen. From this screen you can add/change the treatment plan, add a progress note, or close the assessment.  <br /> 
 
<UL> 
<LI class=bullets1>Select to add a progress note to the assessment for today's visit  
<LI class=bullets1>Select to close the assessment. </LI></UL> 
 <p> 
You can choose to bill or not bill the assessment as part of today's visit. <br /> 
 <br /> 
 </p>
 
 
<LI class=numbers1>If you want to select a new sick assessment, select the New Sick DX button. The Select Sick Assessments screen appears.  
<LI class=numbers1>Select the assessment(s) from the list or use the search options to locate the desired assessment. You can select multiple assessments, as needed. When finished, select OK.  
<LI class=numbers1>For each assessment selected, a treatment list appears to allow you to order treatments for that diagnosis. The treatment list is pre-populated with commonly used treatments for the assessment listed at the top of the screen. To order treatments for this patient, select as many items from the list as desired.  
<LI class=numbers1>If a treatment you want to order does not appear, select the New Treatment button. A menu of treatment types appears. Select the button for the type of treatment you want to order. The appropriate treatment selection screen appears.  <br /> 
 <br /> 
<img src="images/content_note.gif" width="18" border="0"><FONT color=#009900><I>NOTE: Follow-ups and referrals are considered treatments and should be ordered as part of the treatment plan at this point. </I></FONT> <br /> 
 
<LI class=numbers1>Select the treatments you want to order from the list or use the search options to locate the desired treatments. When finished selecting items, select OK to return to the treatment list.  
<LI class=numbers1>When finished selecting treatments for this assessment, select the Finished button. Certain treatments such as prescription drugs, follow-ups, and referrals require additional information. If you chose a treatment that requires additional information, those screens will be presented to you automatically.  
<LI class=numbers1>If more than one assessment was chosen, the treatment list for the next assessment appears. Repeat steps 4 -&nbsp;8 to order treatments for each assessment. When all the treatment screens have been completed, the SOAP screen reappears. If no other assessments need to be documented or treatments updated, you can complete the encounter.</LI></OL>
