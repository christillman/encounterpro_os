<FONT size=4>Purpose</FONT> <br /> 
If a lab or test is not billing with the appropriate CPT code or the number of billed items is incorrect, you can correct that by modifying the configuration of the observations that make up that lab. <br /> 
 <br /> 
There are two places to check when you are having billing problems. The collect procedure and the perform procedure. Collect procedures are items such as venipuncture, specimen handling, etc. Perform procedures use the CPT code for the specific lab or test. You can access both of these from the treatment observation. <br /> 
 </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> </FONT>This will change the billing for the selected procedure(s) and will affect the billing for ALL treatments which use the procedure(s). <br />

<EM><FONT color=#6600ff>To Modify the Observation from a Patient Context:</FONT></EM> </p>
 
 <OL> <LI class=numbers1>Check a test patient into the office. See <U><A href='../../Using EncounterPRO-OS/Encounters/040817812443051.html'>How to: Manually Check in a Patient</A></U> for detailed instructions.  <LI class=numbers1>Go to the Patient Chart and select Other Items. A menu of additional options appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select Any Treatment. A menu of treatment types appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the treatment type for this item. For example, Lab, Test, or X-ray. The selection screen for the treatment type you chose appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the lab or treatment that needs to have the billing modified from the shortlist, if the treatment is not listed there use your search options to locate the treatment to be modified. You can select multiple treatments of this type if needed. Each item selected appears in the Selected Items list.  <LI class=numbers1>Select OK. The Patient Chart reappears.  <LI class=numbers1>Locate the item ordered on the Patient Chart and select the small icon to the left of the description. The entry screen appears. If you select the description, the dashboard screen appears. Select the description of the item on the dashboard and the entry screen appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select Other Options from the bottom of the screen. A menu of options appears.  <LI class=numbers1>Select Configure. The Observation Definition or the Composite Observation Definition screen appears, depending on the treatment you chose.  <LI class=numbers1>If the billing problem concerns the specimen collection billing, select the Collection Procedure button on the right. If the billing problem concerns the perform procedure, go to step 14.  <LI class=numbers1>If the collection procedure is already listed, but is still billing incorrectly, select Edit Procedure. The Collect Procedures configuration screen appears. If there is no collection procedure listed, select Change Procedure. The Select Collect Procedures screen appears.  <br /> 
 <br /> 
 <OL type=a> <LI class=numbers1>Select the correct collection procedure from the list. You may need to use the search options to locate the desired procedure. The Observation Definition screen reappears with the collection procedure displayed.  <LI class=numbers1>Select the collection procedure, then select Edit Procedure from the menu. The Collect Procedures configuration screen appears. </LI></OL> <LI>Review the billing information for the collect procedure. If needed you can change the CPT code, the units, the CPT Modifier and the Billing Rule. The available Billing Rules are as follows: <br /> 
 <UL>
 
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Bill</STRONG> - create a billing entry for every time this procedure is ordered during the encounter 
 
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Don't Bill</STRONG> - never bill for this collect procedure 
 
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Bill 1st charge only</STRONG> - used when you only want to bill this procedure code one time during an encounter, no matter how many times it is used. For example, venipuncture codes are generally billed only once no matter how many specimens are collected 
 
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Bill if 2 or more</STRONG> - Not used 
 
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Accumulate Charges</STRONG> - used to configure Allergy Test procedures.  <br /> 
</LI></UL> <LI class=numbers1>If you do not need to modify the perform procedure, select OK. The entry screen reappears.  <LI class=numbers1>If the perform procedure is already listed, but is still billing incorrectly, select Edit Procedure. The Perform Procedures configuration screen appears. If there is no perform procedure listed, select Change Procedure. The Select Collect Procedures screen appears.  <br /> 
 <br /> 
 <OL type=a> <LI class=numbers1>Select the correct perform procedure from the list. You may need to use the search options to locate the desired procedure.

The Perform Procedures configuration screen appears.  <br /> 
</LI></OL> <LI class=numbers1>Review the billing information for the perform procedure. If needed you can change the CPT code, the units, the CPT Modifier and the Billing Rule. The available Billing Rules are as follows: <br />
