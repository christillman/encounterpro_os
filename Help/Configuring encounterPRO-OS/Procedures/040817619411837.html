While there are several types of procedures available in EncounterPRO, we recommend that you only add the following types: <br /> 
 <UL>
 
<LI class=bullets1>Perform Procedures 
 
<LI class=bullets1>Collect Procedures</LI></UL>  <p> 
These will cover most of your labs, tests, and radiology procedures. Contact EHR Product Support if you need to add or update the other procedure types. <br /> 
 </p>
 
  <p> 
<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> </FONT>Before adding the procedure, do a thorough search to make sure it is not already in the database. <br /> 
Each Perform Procedure should have a corresponding Collect Procedure. After you have added the perform and collect procedures, you must link them together on the Observation screen. See  <a href="040818313442265.html"> How to: Modify Billing for a Lab or Test</a> for detailed instruction. <br />
