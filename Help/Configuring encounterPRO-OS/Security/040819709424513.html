After you have set the user's high-level access privileges on the User Configuration screen, you can refine those privileges using the Authorize Services function. Authorize Services allows the encounterPRO Administrator or Super User to grant and revoke access to specific screens and functions in encounterPRO. An expiration date can even be set for those users who need temporary access. </p>
 
 <p> 
<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> 
</FONT>Review the information in User Access Rights and Authorize Services.  <br /> 
 <br /> 
The default for most services is 'Allow,' meaning that unless otherwise restricted because of the privileges set on the User Configuration screen, all users will be allowed to access the screen or function. For those functions, individual users can be restricted from access. For certain security-sensitive functions the default is 'Don't Allow,' meaning that only Super Users will be allowed access unless a user is specifically granted access. Individual users can be granted special access to those functions. <br /> 
 <br /> 
Functions that default to 'Don't Allow' include: </p>
