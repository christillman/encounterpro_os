There are several levels in the encounterPRO security model. Settings at each level can influence which tasks a user can view or perform.  <br /> 
 <img src="images/090080704162306.jpg" alt="Screen: Inline Image" /> <br /> 
Each level as you go down the pyramid is more specific about which functions are granted or restricted. <br />

 <p> 
<FONT size=4>Levels of Security <br /> 
</FONT>The first level of security is logging into the encounterPRO system. <br /> 
<FONT size=3>User profile <br /> 
</FONT><EM><FONT color=#6600ff>Special Permissions <br /> 
</FONT></EM>Another area in the user profile sets the general permissions granted to that user. There are Special Privileges such as: </p>
 
 
<UL> 
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>May Access Clinical Data</STRONG>&nbsp;-- set to No if the user should not be allowed to view any clinical data  
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>May Prescribe Medications</STRONG>&nbsp;-- set to Yes only for those users who are legally allowed to prescribe medications. If this is set to No, a user will get a warning message when he/she tries to order a prescription medication. The medication can be documented in the chart, but a prescription form will not print.  
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>All privileges and access to all services (Super User)</STRONG> -- If a user is designated a 'Super User' then any other restrictions selected under Permissions and Authorize Services are ignored.</LI></UL> 
 <p> 
 <br /> 
<EM><FONT color=#6600ff>EncounterPRO Privileges <br /> 
</FONT></EM>A second set of permissions that can further refine the user's access and abilities to perform certain tasks includes: <br /> 
 </p>
 
 
<UL> 
<LI class=bullets1>May read audit records&nbsp;-- audit records include user audit logs, encounter audit logs, and assessment and treatment audit logs.  
<LI class=bullets1>May edit common standard exams&nbsp;-- all users can edit their personal standard exams, it may be desirable to restrict the number of users who can edit the common exams.  
<LI class=bullets1>May edit common treatment lists -- all users can edit their personal treatment lists, it may be desirable to restrict the number of users who can edit the common treatment lists.  
<LI class=bullets1>May set or modify computer preferences&nbsp;-- computer-level preferences affect all users who log in to that specific workstation.  
<LI class=bullets1>May use encounterPRO in Configuration Mode&nbsp;-- only users who have been instructed in configuration features should be allowed to use Configuration Mode.  
<LI class=bullets1>May edit procedure charges -- this permission allows a user to change the charges, CPT codes or other billing information for procedures in the database.  
<LI class=bullets1>May edit common short lists -- all users can edit their personal short lists, it may be desirable to restrict the number of users who can edit the common short lists.  
<LI class=bullets1>May edit the visit level and coding for any encounter -- the encounter owner and encounter owner's supervisor can edit the visit level and billing for their encounters, if a billing specialist needs to be able to adjust the billing for an encounter, they need to be granted this privilege.  
<LI class=bullets1>May set or modify global preferences&nbsp;-- global preferences affect every user of the encounterPRO system in your practice. This privilege must be restricted to only those users who have been instructed in encounterPRO configuration.  
<LI class=bullets1>May scribe for other users&nbsp;-- this permission allows a user to document in the patient chart under the user ID of another user, usually a provider.  
<LI class=bullets1>May see the Task List for any user -- if this permission is set to Yes, the user will have an 'Other' tab on the Task list. When the Other tab is selected, he/she can select a user from the practice and view or manage that user's My Task list.  
<LI class=bullets1>May take over any encounter&nbsp;-- Providers can already take over encounters from another provider, this permission allows other clinical staff to be able to take over an encounter from a provider.  
<LI class=bullets1>May set or modify preferences for other users -- this permission should be granted only to those users who have been instructed in encounterPRO configuration. <br /> 
 <br /> 
All the user profile permissions are initially defaulted to No.</LI></UL> 
 <p> 
<FONT size=3>Authorize Services</FONT>  <br /> 
The Authorize Services level of security allows the Super User or EHR Product Support to restrict or grant access to explicit encounterPRO features on a user by user or role by role basis.&nbsp; There is a default security for each service that can be either: </p>
 
 
<UL> 
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Allow</STRONG>&nbsp;-- allow all users to perform this service  
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Don't allow</STRONG>&nbsp;-- allow only those users specifically granted access the ability to perform this task. Sensitive tasks, such as Configure Preferences, and Uncancel Encounter are defaulted to Don't Allow.</LI></UL> 
 <p> 
 <br /> 
<img src="images/content_note.gif" width="18" border="0"><FONT color=#009900><I>NOTE:&nbsp;Users with the Special Permission of 'All privileges and access to all services' are considered Super Users and are always granted access to all services in the Authorize Services lists. You do not have to explicitly grant a Super User access to a service with 'Don't Allow' security.</I></FONT> <br /> 
 <br /> 
<EM><FONT color=#6600ff>Service Types <br /> 
</FONT></EM>The items on the Authorize Services list are at the most granular level. They are divided up by service type: </p>
 
 
<UL> 
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>General</STRONG>&nbsp;-- tasks that can be performed on data across the practice, such as Multiple Chart Export and all Configuration tasks  
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Patient</STRONG>&nbsp;-- tasks that are performed on or for a patient, such as checking in the patient, entering current medications, viewing the patient's chart, etc.  
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Encounter</STRONG>&nbsp;-- tasks that are performed during an encounter, such as changing the patient room, approving an encounter, canceling an encounter, etc.  
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Assessment</STRONG>&nbsp;-- tasks that are specific to assessments, such as adding an attachment, rediagnosing, closing the diagnosis, etc.  
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Treatment</STRONG>&nbsp;-- tasks that are specific to treatments, such as associating a treatment with a specific assessment, ordering treatments, refilling prescriptions, closing treatments, etc.  
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Observation</STRONG>&nbsp;-- tasks that can be performed specific to an observation, such as adding a comment, sending a task related to this observation, etc.  
<LI class=bullets1><STRONG>Attachment</STRONG>&nbsp;-- tasks that can be performed on attachments, such as creating a message or task related to this attachment, creating a document, etc.</LI></UL> 
 <p> 
<FONT size=4>How To Customize Security for Your Practice <br /> 
</FONT>It is best to take a few minutes in the early stages of implementation to discuss with the EHR Implementation Coordinators the make-up of your staff and get a general idea of what permissions you want to grant to which users and if there are specific areas that you want to further restrict access. <br /> 
 <br /> 
Each practice should have at least one user designated as the Super User. This person will need to attend additional instruction to be able to perform those tasks restricted to the Super Users.  <br /> 
 <br /> 
As the practice progresses in using encounterPRO, there may be periodic needs to re-visit the security layout and make changes. Again, your EHR representative can assist you in making those decisions and coordinate educational opportunities. </p>
