<FONT size=4>Description</FONT> <br /> 
To understand what a treatment mode is, we must first understand what a treatment workplan is.&nbsp; A treatment workplan is a defined set of workplan steps that control the behavior of a treatment.&nbsp;  <br /> 
A treatment mode attaches a treatment workplan to a specific treatment to make it behave according to the treatment workplan steps.  <br /> 
 </p>
 
  <p> 
Why Do We Use Treatment Modes? <br /> 
In EncounterPRO, each treatment type is associated with a treatment type default workplan.&nbsp; This treatment type default workplan controls the behavior of all treatments within a treatment type, unless a treatment mode dictates otherwise for a specific treatment. <br /> 
Treatment modes are used whenever there is a need to deviate from the treatment type default workplan. For example: </p>
 
 <UL>
 
<LI class=bullets1>The practice may need certain treatments to behave differently from other treatments within a treatment type. The urinalysis and rapid strep lab tests may be performed in-house, while all other lab specimens are sent out. 
 
<LI class=bullets1>An office location may need certain treatments to behave differently than they do in other office locations. One office location may have the equipment to perform x-rays on site, while the other locations need to send the patients out to a radiology consultant. 
 
<LI class=bullets1>An individual may need certain treatments to behave differently than they do for others in the office or in the practice.</LI></UL>  <p> 
Setting the Default Treatment Mode <br /> 
When you set a default treatment mode, the treatment behaves the same way for all users. For example, if your practice sends all patients out for lab work, you should set the default treatment mode for all labs and tests to Ongoing Send or Refer Out. Default treatment modes are set on the Treatment Type Configuration screen. <br /> 
 </p>
 
  <p> 
Selecting a Treatment Mode On the Fly <br /> 
While in an encounter-context the treatment mode can be changed for a specific treatment or for a specific instance of a treatment.  <br /> 
 <br /> 
If there are a few labs that are performed in the office, you should set the default treatment mode for all labs to something like Ongoing Send or Refer out. Then, from an encounter-context (probably a test patient), select those labs that are performed in-house. After you select the labs, you can change the treatment mode for that specific treatment&nbsp;-- setting either a default for that particular treatment or just for that specific instance of the treatment. See&nbsp;<A href="../../Using EncounterPRO-OS/Treatments/040818615510875.html">How to: Set the Default Treatment Mode for a Specific Treatment</A>&nbsp;for detailed instructions on selecting treatment modes. <br />

<FONT size=4>Available Treatment Modes <br /> </FONT>Treatment modes with "Enc" (encounter) included in the description are used for labs and tests which will be closed at the end of the encounter. Treatment modes with "Ong" (ongoing) included in the description are used for labs and tests which will remain open after the encounter, as they will appear on the Outstanding Labs and Tests screen or Outstanding Other Treatments screen and must be manually closed. <br /> 
 <br /> 
A treatment mode must be configured as one of the options for a specific treatment type in order to be available for use with treatments of that type. The table below lists some of the common treatment types and the treatments modes that are available for that type. <br />
