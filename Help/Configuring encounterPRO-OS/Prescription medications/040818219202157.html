In-office medications are configured similarly to prescription medications. In addition, you need to set up the drug makers and HCPCS codes used for billing information. <br /> 
There are several phases to adding a new in-office medication: <br /> 
 
<OL> 
<LI class=numbers1>Set up drug properties  
<LI class=numbers1>Create drug packages (at least one package is required) 
<LI class=numbers1>Select administration rules (at least one administration rule is required) 
<LI class=numbers1>Determine drug categories (for searching)  
<LI class=numbers1>Select the Specialties that will use this drug  
<LI class=numbers1>Select the HCPCS codes that can be used with this drug (if you want to bill for the drug administered, a HCPCS code is required) 
<LI class=numbers1>Select the makers that manufacture this drug (all makers of the drug which might be used by your practice must be entered) 
<LI class=numbers1>Save the new drug and add to the short list, if desired</LI></OL> 
 <p> 
<FONT size=4>Before You Begin <br /> </FONT>Before you add a new in office medication to the database, you should perform a thorough search of the database to confirm that it does not already exist. Search the drugs for your specialty as well as All Specialties to be sure the drug is not already in the database. </p>
 
 
 <p> 
If the HCPCS procedure code needed&nbsp;are not available when you are configuring the medication, you will need to add those procedure codes on the Procedure Configuration screen. See  <a href="../Procedures/040817619411837.html">Screen: How to: Add a New Procedure</a>. <br />
