--However, as an additional permission, the copyright holders of EncounterPRO Open Source 
--Project give you permission to link the Project with independent components, regardless of 
--the license terms of these independent components, provided that all of the following are true:
--
--1. All access from the independent component to persisted data which resides
--   inside any EncounterPRO Open Source data store (e.g. SQL Server database) 
--   be made through a publically available database driver (e.g. ODBC, SQL 
--   Native Client, etc) or through a service which itself is part of The Project.
--2. The independent component does not create or rely on any code or data 
--   structures within the EncounterPRO Open Source data store unless such 
--   code or data structures, and all code and data structures referred to 
--   by such code or data structures, are themselves part of The Project.
--3. The independent component either a) runs locally on the user's computer,
--   or b) is linked to at runtime by The Project’s Component Manager object 
--   which in turn is called by code which itself is part of The Project.
--
--An independent component is a component which is not derived from or based on the Project.
--If you modify the Project, you may extend this additional permission to your version of 
--the Project, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this 
--additional permission statement from your version.
