-- The purpose of this function is to return each of the "order" events for the specified treatment
-- An "order" in general consists of a specific instance of a provider asking for or confirming
-- the continuation of the treatment
--
-- For point-in-time treatments (e.g. Labs) this will always consist of a single record
-- representing the original order.
-- For continuous treatments (e.g. Prescription Medication) this will consist of the
-- original order plus any instances of reconfirming or reordering the
-- treatment (e.g. prescription refill).

-- EncounterPRO considers the treatment creation to be an order and determines the effective ordered-by
-- provider using the following logic:
-- 
-- 1) If someone signed for the treatment in the encounter in which it was created, then that is the ordered_by provider
-- 2) If no one signed for the treatment in the encounter in which it was created, then the provider
--    who ordered the treatment is the ordered_by provider
-- 
-- EncounterPRO considers every "Refill"progress note to be a re-order where the ordered_by provider is the
-- provider logging the refill.
-- 
-- 
-- Once the orders and ordered-by providers have been determined, then the following logic is used to 
-- determine which signature to display for each order:
-- 
-- If the treatment is a prescription drug treatment, then
--   The ordered-by provider's signature is used if any of the following are true
--   1) the ordered-by provider does not have a supervisor and is certified
--   2) the ordered-by provider has a supervisor and the use_supervisor_signature_stamp is false
-- 
--   If the ordered-by provider has a supervisor then the supervisor's signature is used if either of the following are true:
--   1) the ordered-by provider is not certified
--   2) the ordered-by provider is certified and the use_supervisor_signature_stamp is true
-- 
-- 
-- If the treatment is NOT a prescription drug treatment, then
--   The ordered-by provider's signature is used if any of the following are true
--   1) the ordered-by provider does not have a supervisor
--   2) the ordered-by provider has a supervisor and the use_supervisor_signature_stamp is false
-- 
--   If the ordered-by provider has a supervisor then the supervisor's signature is used if either of the following are true:
--   2) the ordered-by provider the use_supervisor_signature_stamp is true
-- 
-- 
-- 
--   If an actual signature is available from the prescription, then the actual signature is used.  Otherwise, 
--   the appropriate signature stamp is used.  Note that whether or not a signature stamp is available or used 
--   is subject to two preferences, namely rx_use_signature_stamp and rx_always_use_signature_stamp.
